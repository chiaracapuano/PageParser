This week we go back to Wizards of the Coast to talk to Mark Rosewater, the head designer for Magic: The Gathering. Last week, Alison told Jordan all about creating the stories behind Magic cards. And it’s the job of Mark and his team to come up with the mechanics of those  cards. Mark explains how, once he and his team come up with the creative concept for a particular Magic set, there are a lot of other things to think about. They have to figure out not only how that deck works on its own, but also how it fits into a game that already has tens of thousands of cards already out there -- not to mention all the various ways the massive fanbase can play with those cards. The calculations are so complex, they even have a full-time economist on staff.Email us: working@slate.comLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices

For many people, an eviction means that they will be left without anywhere else to go. And often, tenants are fighting landlords with much more money and resources. But New York has recently put a program in place to offer free representation to people in Housing Court who can’t afford a lawyer. Mark talks about what it’s like to fight for people’s housing rights, the wildest things he’s heard in Housing Court, and just how much he’s had to learn about carpentry to do his job.Learn more about your ad choices.

To wrap up the season on the Influencer Industry, Rachelle talks to Jess Hunichen, co-founder of talent agency Shine Influencers. Jess cut her teeth as a traditional film and television agent when she lived in Australia. But when she had trouble finding work after a move to Toronto, she and Shine co-founder Emily Ward found a completely new niche market. After first starting Shine PR, the duo quickly saw the need for talent representation in the world of social media. So they began Shine Influencers, which now has offices in Toronto, Montreal, and Los Angeles. Jess tells Rachelle how representing influencers is different from working with traditional celebrities, what she looks for in clients, and why social media still feels like the Wild West.Learn more about your ad choices.

Sean McElwee has one of those jobs you certainly know about, but probably can't pinpoint what it is he does all day. Sean runs a think tank called Data for Progress that he started with Colin McAuliffe. As for what they do as an organization, the name says it all, they collect data to help push liberal political policies and ideas forward. But the way they do it may not be what you expect. Data for Progress is a part of new wave of smaller think tanks running on more of a startup model. Which means a lot of Sean's job is about figuring out ways to affect political change without the resources of much bigger institutions in their field.Learn more about your ad choices.

And it’s the job of Mark and his team to come up with the mechanics of those  cards. Mark explains how, once he and his team come up with the creative concept for a particular Magic set, there are a lot of other things to think about. They have to figure out not only how that deck works on its own, but also how it fits into a game that already has tens of thousands of cards already out there -- not to mention all the various ways the massive fanbase can play with those cards. The calculations are so complex, they even have a full-time economist on staff.Email us: working@slate.comLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices

Rejection can be an incredibly demoralizing experience. When we hear “no,” it’s easy to start doubting ourselves and giving in to our insecurities. But in life, and especially in business, success often hinges on our ability to bounce back from rejection. So how do we not only move forward after a disappointment, but use it as a learning experience to get to the next level? In Episode 4, we talked to someone who puts himself out there on a regular basis: award-winning stand-up comedian and actor Adam Ferrara.

Sean McElwee has one of those jobs you certainly know about, but probably can't pinpoint what it is he does all day. Sean runs a think tank called Data for Progress that he started with Colin McAuliffe. As for what they do as an organization, the name says it all, they collect data to help push liberal political policies and ideas forward. But the way they do it may not be what you expect. Data for Progress is a part of new wave of smaller think tanks running on more of a startup model. Which means a lot of Sean's job is about figuring out ways to affect political change without the resources of much bigger institutions in their field.Learn more about your ad choices.

This week we go back to Wizards of the Coast to talk to Mark Rosewater, the head designer for Magic: The Gathering. Last week, Alison told Jordan all about creating the stories behind Magic cards. And it’s the job of Mark and his team to come up with the mechanics of those  cards. Mark explains how, once he and his team come up with the creative concept for a particular Magic set, there are a lot of other things to think about. They have to figure out not only how that deck works on its own, but also how it fits into a game that already has tens of thousands of cards already out there -- not to mention all the various ways the massive fanbase can play with those cards. The calculations are so complex, they even have a full-time economist on staff.Email us: working@slate.comLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices

Sean McElwee has one of those jobs you certainly know about, but probably can't pinpoint what it is he does all day. Sean runs a think tank called Data for Progress that he started with Colin McAuliffe. As for what they do as an organization, the name says it all, they collect data to help push liberal political policies and ideas forward. But the way they do it may not be what you expect. Data for Progress is a part of new wave of smaller think tanks running on more of a startup model. Which means a lot of Sean's job is about figuring out ways to affect political change without the resources of much bigger institutions in their field.Learn more about your ad choices.

This week we go back to Wizards of the Coast to talk to Mark Rosewater, the head designer for Magic: The Gathering. Last week, Alison told Jordan all about creating the stories behind Magic cards. And it’s the job of Mark and his team to come up with the mechanics of those  cards. Mark explains how, once he and his team come up with the creative concept for a particular Magic set, there are a lot of other things to think about. They have to figure out not only how that deck works on its own, but also how it fits into a game that already has tens of thousands of cards already out there -- not to mention all the various ways the massive fanbase can play with those cards. The calculations are so complex, they even have a full-time economist on staff.Email us: working@slate.comLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices

Sean McElwee has one of those jobs you certainly know about, but probably can't pinpoint what it is he does all day. Sean runs a think tank called Data for Progress that he started with Colin McAuliffe. As for what they do as an organization, the name says it all, they collect data to help push liberal political policies and ideas forward. But the way they do it may not be what you expect. Data for Progress is a part of new wave of smaller think tanks running on more of a startup model. Which means a lot of Sean's job is about figuring out ways to affect political change without the resources of much bigger institutions in their field.Learn more about your ad choices.

This week we go back to Wizards of the Coast to talk to Mark Rosewater, the head designer for Magic: The Gathering. Last week, Alison told Jordan all about creating the stories behind Magic cards. And it’s the job of Mark and his team to come up with the mechanics of those  cards. Mark explains how, once he and his team come up with the creative concept for a particular Magic set, there are a lot of other things to think about. They have to figure out not only how that deck works on its own, but also how it fits into a game that already has tens of thousands of cards already out there -- not to mention all the various ways the massive fanbase can play with those cards. The calculations are so complex, they even have a full-time economist on staff.Email us: working@slate.comLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices

In a special five-episode mini-season of Working, we talk with people who have had “second acts,” that is people who made a dramatic career pivot at some point in their working lives.Patty Stonesifer was running a computer-book publisher in Indianapolis when Microsoft recruited her to run its publishing division. In 10 years at the company, she rose to senior vice president of the Interactive Media Division—where one of the sites she launched was Slate. (Stonesifer is now married to the magazine’s founding editor, Michael Kinsley.) When she left the tech giant, Bill Gates recruited her to lead what became the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. After a decade there, she left to become the president and CEO of Martha’s Table, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit. She has also served as chair of the Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents, was appointed by President Barack Obama to lead the White House Council for Community Solutions, and is the lead director of the corporate board of Amazon.com. Learn more about your ad choices.

He went to work for Delta Airlines, eventually focusing on the company’s environmental programs. In 2001, when Delta offered an early retirement package, Allen decided to make his youthful ambitions come true. At 56, he sent out between 60 and 80 applications, eventually securing a position as a “fee collector” at Vicksburg National Military Park. “That’s the guy who sits at the gate and takes $5 as the cars come through,” he explains. After stops at three other parks in the South, he landed at Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park.Now retired, Allen talks about the challenges of making his career move; what he enjoyed about being a park ranger; and why everyone should visit the Andersonville National Historic Site.

Of all the people who work at MoMA, there very few who get as up close and personal with the artwork as the museum's art handlers and registrars. Registrars are the people responsible for keeping tracking of every inch of every piece of art that belongs to the museum. They thoroughly inspect and catalog each detail and always know where everything is at all times. Meanwhile, art handlers are the ones trusted with physically moving the pieces. They’re the only department outside of conservation who are actually allowed to touch the artwork. Jordan talks to Steven Wheeler and Sarah Wood about the special privileges and particular pet peeves of working in these two departments at MoMA.

Tania is the person charged with dreaming up events worthy of MoMA-lovers. To do her job right, Tania has to make sure every detail of each party is interesting, memorable and, just as important, perfectly executed.

When you look at the rows of greeting cards at your local pharmacy or megastore, it’s easy to forget that each one of those cards was actually written by someone. And, if they’re anything like our guest, that person put some very real emotion into writing the sentiment inside. For this holiday bonus episode, Jordan speaks to Greg Vovos who is a senior writer at American Greetings and is exactly the kind of person you want writing for you. Greg truly believes in the power of giving a card to someone. Whether they’re funny or sympathetic or romantic, Greg writes his cards to foster a connection between giver and receiver.

When you look at the rows of greeting cards at your local pharmacy or megastore, it’s easy to forget that each one of those cards was actually written by someone. And, if they’re anything like our guest, that person put some very real emotion into writing the sentiment inside. For this holiday bonus episode, Jordan speaks to Greg Vovos who is a senior writer at American Greetings and is exactly the kind of person you want writing for you. Greg truly believes in the power of giving a card to someone. Whether they’re funny or sympathetic or romantic, Greg writes his cards to foster a connection between giver and receiver. Greg tells Jordan about where he gets his inspiration, the challenges of staying fresh and why you really shouldn’t be cynical about a store bought card.

Anny Aviram has been conserving paintings at MoMA for 40 years. So, as can imagine, she’s had her hands on some of the world’s most famous artworks. And, occasionally, her saliva.

And, as Anny tells Jordan, not only does the technology of conservation change over the years, but so does the aesthetics. So, sometimes conservators are even tasked with undoing their own work from years before. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices

For her first season hosting Working, Slate’s Shannon Palus is delving into the world of running, from professional athletes to coaches to people who do all manner of things to help other people run.This week, Shannon talks to Thomas Panek, president and CEO of Guiding Eye for the Blind, a nonprofit training school for guide dogs. Thomas is also a lifelong runner. But, as he tells Shannon, when he lost his eyesight, he thought his running days were over. Eventually, with the help of a human running guide, he got back into the sport. And as CEO of a guide-dog school, he came to realize that dogs are perfectly suited to be running guides themselves. Thomas was the first person to run a half-marathon with guide dogs last year, and he is on a mission to help more blind people have the freedom to run.Podcast production by Jessamine Molli.Learn more about your ad choices.

Rejection can be an incredibly demoralizing experience. When we hear “no,” it’s easy to start doubting ourselves and giving in to our insecurities. But in life, and especially in business, success often hinges on our ability to bounce back from rejection. So how do we not only move forward after a disappointment, but use it as a learning experience to get to the next level? In Episode 4, we talked to someone who puts himself out there on a regular basis: award-winning stand-up comedian and actor Adam Ferrara.

Sean McElwee has one of those jobs you certainly know about, but probably can't pinpoint what it is he does all day. Sean runs a think tank called Data for Progress that he started with Colin McAuliffe. As for what they do as an organization, the name says it all, they collect data to help push liberal political policies and ideas forward. But the way they do it may not be what you expect. Data for Progress is a part of new wave of smaller think tanks running on more of a startup model. Which means a lot of Sean's job is about figuring out ways to affect political change without the resources of much bigger institutions in their field.Learn more about your ad choices.

This week we go back to Wizards of the Coast to talk to Mark Rosewater, the head designer for Magic: The Gathering. Last week, Alison told Jordan all about creating the stories behind Magic cards. And it’s the job of Mark and his team to come up with the mechanics of those  cards. Mark explains how, once he and his team come up with the creative concept for a particular Magic set, there are a lot of other things to think about. They have to figure out not only how that deck works on its own, but also how it fits into a game that already has tens of thousands of cards already out there -- not to mention all the various ways the massive fanbase can play with those cards. The calculations are so complex, they even have a full-time economist on staff.Email us: working@slate.comLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices

In a special five-episode mini-season of Working, we talk with people who have had “second acts,” that is people who made a dramatic career pivot at some point in their working lives.Patty Stonesifer was running a computer-book publisher in Indianapolis when Microsoft recruited her to run its publishing division. In 10 years at the company, she rose to senior vice president of the Interactive Media Division—where one of the sites she launched was Slate. (Stonesifer is now married to the magazine’s founding editor, Michael Kinsley.) When she left the tech giant, Bill Gates recruited her to lead what became the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. After a decade there, she left to become the president and CEO of Martha’s Table, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit. She has also served as chair of the Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents, was appointed by President Barack Obama to lead the White House Council for Community Solutions, and is the lead director of the corporate board of Amazon.com. Learn more about your ad choices.

He went to work for Delta Airlines, eventually focusing on the company’s environmental programs. In 2001, when Delta offered an early retirement package, Allen decided to make his youthful ambitions come true. At 56, he sent out between 60 and 80 applications, eventually securing a position as a “fee collector” at Vicksburg National Military Park. “That’s the guy who sits at the gate and takes $5 as the cars come through,” he explains. After stops at three other parks in the South, he landed at Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park.Now retired, Allen talks about the challenges of making his career move; what he enjoyed about being a park ranger; and why everyone should visit the Andersonville National Historic Site.

Of all the people who work at MoMA, there very few who get as up close and personal with the artwork as the museum's art handlers and registrars. Registrars are the people responsible for keeping tracking of every inch of every piece of art that belongs to the museum. They thoroughly inspect and catalog each detail and always know where everything is at all times. Meanwhile, art handlers are the ones trusted with physically moving the pieces. They’re the only department outside of conservation who are actually allowed to touch the artwork. Jordan talks to Steven Wheeler and Sarah Wood about the special privileges and particular pet peeves of working in these two departments at MoMA.

To do her job right, Tania has to make sure every detail of each party is interesting, memorable and, just as important, perfectly executed.

Nelson talks to Jordan about keeping workers on their toes, the comedy of trying to capture stray animals that fly into the building, and what happened the time a heart doctor had a heart attack in the middle of the building.

When you think about the types of jobs at an art museum, scientist probably doesn’t spring to mind. But as it turns out, science plays a big part in the art world. As a senior conservation scientist at MoMA, Chris McGlinchey uses the latest scientific techniques to conserve the collection and study the art. Chris tells Jordan about all the complex machines he uses, the extremely tiny scale conservators work on, and how he figured out how to fill the museum with sugar cane that won’t rot.

When you look at the rows of greeting cards at your local pharmacy or megastore, it’s easy to forget that each one of those cards was actually written by someone. And, if they’re anything like our guest, that person put some very real emotion into writing the sentiment inside. For this holiday bonus episode, Jordan speaks to Greg Vovos who is a senior writer at American Greetings and is exactly the kind of person you want writing for you. Greg truly believes in the power of giving a card to someone. Whether they’re funny or sympathetic or romantic, Greg writes his cards to foster a connection between giver and receiver. Greg tells Jordan about where he gets his inspiration, the challenges of staying fresh and why you really shouldn’t be cynical about a store bought card.

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

I made it clear how much I lack the skills to draw or be artistic in any sort of way, but after last week's minisode about stopping myself from saying that I "can't" do something, I'm trying to change my language and how I speak about my drawing skills.

This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.  Of course, this is perfectionism peeping it's ugly head into my subconscious again and I'm sure many of you may feel the same. It's uncomfortable to do new things but to quote marketing expert Seth Godin, "fear is a compass, not a barrier. It becomes a way to know what to do next, not an evil demon to be extinguished."Tune into this episode to find what you can do to start doing that one thing you feel like you "can't" do, but have always wanted to.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode28     Like the show?

Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome. Misconceptions about what it's like to work in the tech industry. Advice to young women who want to work in tech. What lights them up the most in their career as founders of a tech company.

Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

This week I chatted with Emily Mills who is obviously a creative and artistic genius. I made it clear how much I lack the skills to draw or be artistic in any sort of way, but after last week's minisode about stopping myself from saying that I "can't" do something, I'm trying to change my language and how I speak about my drawing skills.  I then started looking into how drawing can positively impact your days -- and boy, I found a lot of research on this!

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-whats-something-that-you-feel-like-you-cant-do/id1292726596?i=1000431350062
This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.  Of course, this is perfectionism peeping it's ugly head into my subconscious again and I'm sure many of you may feel the same. It's uncomfortable to do new things but to quote marketing expert Seth Godin, "fear is a compass, not a barrier. It becomes a way to know what to do next, not an evil demon to be extinguished."Tune into this episode to find what you can do to start doing that one thing you feel like you "can't" do, but have always wanted to.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode28     Like the show?

Today's interview is special because it's another double interview! We haven't had one of those since interviewing World Travelers Lisa & Peter Hoppe. Anyways, I'm interviewing Sandy Connery & Jeni Barcelos who are the founders of a software company called Namastream.  Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome. Misconceptions about what it's like to work in the tech industry. Advice to young women who want to work in tech. What lights them up the most in their career as founders of a tech company.

Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities. Tune in to find out the two ways I'm being more vulnerable in 2019, tips for how you can too, and my challenge on being more vulnerable.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode21 Links mentioned:    Setting fear aside minisode  Brene Brown’s TED Talk on vulnerability Daring Greatly by Brene Brown Day in the Life Facebook group   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello hello and welcome back to the Day in the Life podcast! Happy 2019 everyone!   I can't believe we are already halfway through the first month of 2019, so crazy! Anyways, before we get to today's episode, I wanted to share a few housekeeping updates before diving in. As most of you know, this podcast is a passion project of mine and not a primary way I make income. I was feeling really burnt out from all of the work I had taken on and taking a break was really good for me.   So, with that, we’ll be making some changes around here!   1) We're going to try something new for the podcast this year...we'll be doing seasons!Our "second" season will run January 15-April 2 and we will take a 6-week break in between before the third season starts.  I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

Hey Day in the Life listeners! We're taking the rest of 2018 off from releasing new episodes but we wanted to share a few fan-favorite episodes in case you missed them the first time around. Enjoy!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Activist located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an activist.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-whats-something-that-you-feel-like-you-cant-do/id1292726596?i=1000431350062
This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.  Of course, this is perfectionism peeping it's ugly head into my subconscious again and I'm sure many of you may feel the same. It's uncomfortable to do new things but to quote marketing expert Seth Godin, "fear is a compass, not a barrier. It becomes a way to know what to do next, not an evil demon to be extinguished."Tune into this episode to find what you can do to start doing that one thing you feel like you "can't" do, but have always wanted to.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode28     Like the show?

Today's interview is special because it's another double interview! We haven't had one of those since interviewing World Travelers Lisa & Peter Hoppe. Anyways, I'm interviewing Sandy Connery & Jeni Barcelos who are the founders of a software company called Namastream.  Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome. Misconceptions about what it's like to work in the tech industry. Advice to young women who want to work in tech. What lights them up the most in their career as founders of a tech company.

Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

Today's minisode we're talking about why I stopped following the news. Meg and I talked about social media and how she stopped sharing as much of her personal life on social media which led me to share how I've stopped paying attention to the news and I wanted to dive in deeper into this topic as I'm sure people have a variety of thoughts and feelings on this topic. First off, it's very difficult for me to "completely" turn off from any and all news as much of my career is based off of being on my computer/internet and being active on social media.  However, I have significantly reduced the amount of time I spend consuming the news, talking about the news, etc.  Tune in to find out why I did this, how it's significantly improved my life, and why you need to consider removing the negative from your life to.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode23 Links mentioned:    Natalie Bacon Natalie Bacon Instagram   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities. Tune in to find out the two ways I'm being more vulnerable in 2019, tips for how you can too, and my challenge on being more vulnerable.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode21 Links mentioned:    Setting fear aside minisode  Brene Brown’s TED Talk on vulnerability Daring Greatly by Brene Brown Day in the Life Facebook group   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello hello and welcome back to the Day in the Life podcast! Happy 2019 everyone!   I can't believe we are already halfway through the first month of 2019, so crazy! Anyways, before we get to today's episode, I wanted to share a few housekeeping updates before diving in. As most of you know, this podcast is a passion project of mine and not a primary way I make income. I was feeling really burnt out from all of the work I had taken on and taking a break was really good for me.   So, with that, we’ll be making some changes around here!   1) We're going to try something new for the podcast this year...we'll be doing seasons!Our "second" season will run January 15-April 2 and we will take a 6-week break in between before the third season starts.  I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

Hey Day in the Life listeners! We're taking the rest of 2018 off from releasing new episodes but we wanted to share a few fan-favorite episodes in case you missed them the first time around. Enjoy!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Activist located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an activist.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

  Today's minisode I'm sharing my thoughts on having a life purpose and what to do when you feel like you don't have one.  I feel like in today's society, it's pushed on us to figure out our "life's purpose" otherwise we're living up to our potential. The fact is, sometimes you're going through a time in your life when it's hard to know what your exact "purpose" is and that's totally okay! Tune in to hear my thoughts on the matter.

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

This week I chatted with Emily Mills who is obviously a creative and artistic genius. I made it clear how much I lack the skills to draw or be artistic in any sort of way, but after last week's minisode about stopping myself from saying that I "can't" do something, I'm trying to change my language and how I speak about my drawing skills.  I then started looking into how drawing can positively impact your days -- and boy, I found a lot of research on this!

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-whats-something-that-you-feel-like-you-cant-do/id1292726596?i=1000431350062
This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.  Of course, this is perfectionism peeping it's ugly head into my subconscious again and I'm sure many of you may feel the same. It's uncomfortable to do new things but to quote marketing expert Seth Godin, "fear is a compass, not a barrier. It becomes a way to know what to do next, not an evil demon to be extinguished."Tune into this episode to find what you can do to start doing that one thing you feel like you "can't" do, but have always wanted to.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode28     Like the show?

Today's interview is special because it's another double interview! We haven't had one of those since interviewing World Travelers Lisa & Peter Hoppe. Anyways, I'm interviewing Sandy Connery & Jeni Barcelos who are the founders of a software company called Namastream.  Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome. Misconceptions about what it's like to work in the tech industry. Advice to young women who want to work in tech. What lights them up the most in their career as founders of a tech company.

Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities. Tune in to find out the two ways I'm being more vulnerable in 2019, tips for how you can too, and my challenge on being more vulnerable.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode21 Links mentioned:    Setting fear aside minisode  Brene Brown’s TED Talk on vulnerability Daring Greatly by Brene Brown Day in the Life Facebook group   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello hello and welcome back to the Day in the Life podcast! Happy 2019 everyone!   I can't believe we are already halfway through the first month of 2019, so crazy! Anyways, before we get to today's episode, I wanted to share a few housekeeping updates before diving in. As most of you know, this podcast is a passion project of mine and not a primary way I make income. I was feeling really burnt out from all of the work I had taken on and taking a break was really good for me.   So, with that, we’ll be making some changes around here!   1) We're going to try something new for the podcast this year...we'll be doing seasons!Our "second" season will run January 15-April 2 and we will take a 6-week break in between before the third season starts.  I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

Hey Day in the Life listeners! We're taking the rest of 2018 off from releasing new episodes but we wanted to share a few fan-favorite episodes in case you missed them the first time around. Enjoy!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Activist located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an activist.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide.

How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

  Today's minisode I'm sharing my thoughts on having a life purpose and what to do when you feel like you don't have one.  I feel like in today's society, it's pushed on us to figure out our "life's purpose" otherwise we're living up to our potential. The fact is, sometimes you're going through a time in your life when it's hard to know what your exact "purpose" is and that's totally okay! Tune in to hear my thoughts on the matter.

A common thread throughout many Day in the Life episodes is that we all don’t have enough time and that we all feel overwhelmed. Adding more ease and calmness into your daily life will help combat at least some of those feelings of overwhelm and perhaps even make your days flow more easily.

Today's minisode we're talking about the importance of investing in yourself.I think many of us fail to realize the value in investing in ourselves. Sometimes we use the excuse that we can't afford it, other times we use the excuse that we don't have time. But honestly, one of the absolute best things you can do for your well being AND for your wallet is to invest in yourself in some sort of way. I really think the reason why some of us don't "invest" in ourselves is that we fear we won't be perfect at whatever it is that we're trying to do, so we'd rather not try at all. I get it, as a fellow perfectionist that's constantly working on that, I totally understand.  BUT sometimes we just need to do something different and out of our comfort zones to truly better ourselves.  Now when I say "invest in yourself" I don't necessarily mean only monetary ways, like professional development/workshops/educational purposes...though those are awesome! I also mean investing in things like your health, hobbies, relationships, etc.  Tune in to the episode to find out the 5 ways you can start investing in yourself today!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode13 Links mentioned:    SSR Podcast My interview on the SSR podcast Day in the Life of Alli Hoff Kosik, Freelance Writer Sign up for the Day in the Life newsletter    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about creativity and how it can make your life better.   Creativity was a topic that came a lot throughout my interview with Eric Lee of Left Field Labs both in the workplace and in life.   I think most people either label themselves as "creative" or "not creative" but in reality, everyone is creative in their own individual way.   Creativity is one of the most important characteristics of being human. A creative mind can enrich your life, making life so much more interesting instead of going aimlessly throughout your days. Being creative doesn't mean that you have to be an artist, maker, or creator of some sort...there are ways to be creative throughout your daily life and that's what we're going to cover in today's minisode!   I share a personal example of how I'm trying to creatively approach a new way thinking about how I spend my time and I'd love to hear your thoughts on creativity. Be sure to head on over to the Facebook group and join the conversation!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/creativity   Like the show? There are several ways you can help!

Hey hey happy minisode Friday! This week's interview with Nicholas Collins was a fun one and one thing we talked about a lot was social media and the presence it plays in kids lives.   As someone that started their career in social media, I've always had a weird relationship with it. Like, part of me loves it and it's brought me to some of my closest friends. It can definitely be used for inspiration and connection.   But the other part of me really struggles with it because I don't want to feel constantly tied to my phone and to be honest, I like having part of my life private. I don't want to share EVERYTHING about my life.   It's hard for me to completely disconnect because it is very tied to my job, but at times I do have to completely step away.   In today's minisode, I share reasons why we should ALL spend less time on social media and 3 tips on how you can limit your time.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com//less-time-social-media   Links mentioned:     Moment iPhone app  AntiSocial Android app    Like the show?

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-whats-something-that-you-feel-like-you-cant-do/id1292726596?i=1000431350062
This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.  Of course, this is perfectionism peeping it's ugly head into my subconscious again and I'm sure many of you may feel the same. It's uncomfortable to do new things but to quote marketing expert Seth Godin, "fear is a compass, not a barrier. It becomes a way to know what to do next, not an evil demon to be extinguished."Tune into this episode to find what you can do to start doing that one thing you feel like you "can't" do, but have always wanted to.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode28     Like the show?

This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.

Today's interview is special because it's another double interview! We haven't had one of those since interviewing World Travelers Lisa & Peter Hoppe. Anyways, I'm interviewing Sandy Connery & Jeni Barcelos who are the founders of a software company called Namastream.  Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome. Misconceptions about what it's like to work in the tech industry. Advice to young women who want to work in tech. What lights them up the most in their career as founders of a tech company.

Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

Today's minisode we're talking about why I stopped following the news. Meg and I talked about social media and how she stopped sharing as much of her personal life on social media which led me to share how I've stopped paying attention to the news and I wanted to dive in deeper into this topic as I'm sure people have a variety of thoughts and feelings on this topic. First off, it's very difficult for me to "completely" turn off from any and all news as much of my career is based off of being on my computer/internet and being active on social media.  However, I have significantly reduced the amount of time I spend consuming the news, talking about the news, etc.  Tune in to find out why I did this, how it's significantly improved my life, and why you need to consider removing the negative from your life to.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode23 Links mentioned:    Natalie Bacon Natalie Bacon Instagram   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities. Tune in to find out the two ways I'm being more vulnerable in 2019, tips for how you can too, and my challenge on being more vulnerable.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode21 Links mentioned:    Setting fear aside minisode  Brene Brown’s TED Talk on vulnerability Daring Greatly by Brene Brown Day in the Life Facebook group   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello hello and welcome back to the Day in the Life podcast! Happy 2019 everyone!   I can't believe we are already halfway through the first month of 2019, so crazy! Anyways, before we get to today's episode, I wanted to share a few housekeeping updates before diving in. As most of you know, this podcast is a passion project of mine and not a primary way I make income. I was feeling really burnt out from all of the work I had taken on and taking a break was really good for me.   So, with that, we’ll be making some changes around here!   1) We're going to try something new for the podcast this year...we'll be doing seasons!Our "second" season will run January 15-April 2 and we will take a 6-week break in between before the third season starts.  I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

Hey Day in the Life listeners! We're taking the rest of 2018 off from releasing new episodes but we wanted to share a few fan-favorite episodes in case you missed them the first time around. Enjoy!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Activist located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an activist.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

A common thread throughout many Day in the Life episodes is that we all don’t have enough time and that we all feel overwhelmed. Adding more ease and calmness into your daily life will help combat at least some of those feelings of overwhelm and perhaps even make your days flow more easily.

Today's minisode we're talking about the importance of investing in yourself.I think many of us fail to realize the value in investing in ourselves. Sometimes we use the excuse that we can't afford it, other times we use the excuse that we don't have time. But honestly, one of the absolute best things you can do for your well being AND for your wallet is to invest in yourself in some sort of way. I really think the reason why some of us don't "invest" in ourselves is that we fear we won't be perfect at whatever it is that we're trying to do, so we'd rather not try at all. I get it, as a fellow perfectionist that's constantly working on that, I totally understand.  BUT sometimes we just need to do something different and out of our comfort zones to truly better ourselves.  Now when I say "invest in yourself" I don't necessarily mean only monetary ways, like professional development/workshops/educational purposes...though those are awesome! I also mean investing in things like your health, hobbies, relationships, etc.  Tune in to the episode to find out the 5 ways you can start investing in yourself today!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode13 Links mentioned:    SSR Podcast My interview on the SSR podcast Day in the Life of Alli Hoff Kosik, Freelance Writer Sign up for the Day in the Life newsletter    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about creativity and how it can make your life better.   Creativity was a topic that came a lot throughout my interview with Eric Lee of Left Field Labs both in the workplace and in life.   I think most people either label themselves as "creative" or "not creative" but in reality, everyone is creative in their own individual way.   Creativity is one of the most important characteristics of being human. A creative mind can enrich your life, making life so much more interesting instead of going aimlessly throughout your days. Being creative doesn't mean that you have to be an artist, maker, or creator of some sort...there are ways to be creative throughout your daily life and that's what we're going to cover in today's minisode!   I share a personal example of how I'm trying to creatively approach a new way thinking about how I spend my time and I'd love to hear your thoughts on creativity.

Hey hey happy minisode Friday! This week's interview with Nicholas Collins was a fun one and one thing we talked about a lot was social media and the presence it plays in kids lives.   As someone that started their career in social media, I've always had a weird relationship with it. Like, part of me loves it and it's brought me to some of my closest friends. It can definitely be used for inspiration and connection.   But the other part of me really struggles with it because I don't want to feel constantly tied to my phone and to be honest, I like having part of my life private. I don't want to share EVERYTHING about my life.   It's hard for me to completely disconnect because it is very tied to my job, but at times I do have to completely step away.   In today's minisode, I share reasons why we should ALL spend less time on social media and 3 tips on how you can limit your time.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com//less-time-social-media   Links mentioned:     Moment iPhone app  AntiSocial Android app    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about budgeting! I was not always a budgeter, that's for sure.

Budgeting is what allowed me to start my own business and get ahead at life.   In this episode, I share why budgeting is important and more importantly, how to get started!   Enjoy!   Full show notes at: how-i-budget   Links mentioned:    You Need a Budget Mint Every Dollar    Like the show?

I love hearing about people's morning routines. It's so interesting, because there's no one right way to conduct your morning.   Some Day in the Life guests wake up as early as 4am, others don't start until 10am. Some have a strict morning routine of writing in their 5 Minute Journal, others leisurely get up and see where the day takes them.   One main takeaway I've had over the past year of recording interviews is morning routines is specific to the individual. What works for one person might not work for another. And isn't that the beauty of life?   I compiled a variety of clips from past episodes talking about morning routines and my hope is that you get some inspiration to try something new for your morning routine.

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

This week I chatted with Emily Mills who is obviously a creative and artistic genius. I made it clear how much I lack the skills to draw or be artistic in any sort of way, but after last week's minisode about stopping myself from saying that I "can't" do something, I'm trying to change my language and how I speak about my drawing skills.  I then started looking into how drawing can positively impact your days -- and boy, I found a lot of research on this!

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-whats-something-that-you-feel-like-you-cant-do/id1292726596?i=1000431350062
This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.  Of course, this is perfectionism peeping it's ugly head into my subconscious again and I'm sure many of you may feel the same. It's uncomfortable to do new things but to quote marketing expert Seth Godin, "fear is a compass, not a barrier. It becomes a way to know what to do next, not an evil demon to be extinguished."Tune into this episode to find what you can do to start doing that one thing you feel like you "can't" do, but have always wanted to.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode28     Like the show?

Today's interview is special because it's another double interview! We haven't had one of those since interviewing World Travelers Lisa & Peter Hoppe. Anyways, I'm interviewing Sandy Connery & Jeni Barcelos who are the founders of a software company called Namastream.  Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome. Misconceptions about what it's like to work in the tech industry. Advice to young women who want to work in tech. What lights them up the most in their career as founders of a tech company.

Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-why-i-stopped-following-news-how-my-life-has/id1292726596?i=1000428919049
Today's minisode we're talking about why I stopped following the news. Meg and I talked about social media and how she stopped sharing as much of her personal life on social media which led me to share how I've stopped paying attention to the news and I wanted to dive in deeper into this topic as I'm sure people have a variety of thoughts and feelings on this topic. First off, it's very difficult for me to "completely" turn off from any and all news as much of my career is based off of being on my computer/internet and being active on social media.  However, I have significantly reduced the amount of time I spend consuming the news, talking about the news, etc.  Tune in to find out why I did this, how it's significantly improved my life, and why you need to consider removing the negative from your life to.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode23 Links mentioned:    Natalie Bacon Natalie Bacon Instagram   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities. Tune in to find out the two ways I'm being more vulnerable in 2019, tips for how you can too, and my challenge on being more vulnerable.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode21 Links mentioned:    Setting fear aside minisode  Brene Brown’s TED Talk on vulnerability Daring Greatly by Brene Brown Day in the Life Facebook group   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello hello and welcome back to the Day in the Life podcast! Happy 2019 everyone!   I can't believe we are already halfway through the first month of 2019, so crazy! Anyways, before we get to today's episode, I wanted to share a few housekeeping updates before diving in. As most of you know, this podcast is a passion project of mine and not a primary way I make income. I was feeling really burnt out from all of the work I had taken on and taking a break was really good for me.   So, with that, we’ll be making some changes around here!   1) We're going to try something new for the podcast this year...we'll be doing seasons!Our "second" season will run January 15-April 2 and we will take a 6-week break in between before the third season starts.  I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

Hey Day in the Life listeners! We're taking the rest of 2018 off from releasing new episodes but we wanted to share a few fan-favorite episodes in case you missed them the first time around. Enjoy!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Activist located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an activist.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

  Today's minisode I'm sharing my thoughts on having a life purpose and what to do when you feel like you don't have one.  I feel like in today's society, it's pushed on us to figure out our "life's purpose" otherwise we're living up to our potential. The fact is, sometimes you're going through a time in your life when it's hard to know what your exact "purpose" is and that's totally okay! Tune in to hear my thoughts on the matter. I'd love to hear your thoughts too. Feel free to hit me up on Twitter or Instagram.

But honestly, one of the absolute best things you can do for your well being AND for your wallet is to invest in yourself in some sort of way. I really think the reason why some of us don't "invest" in ourselves is that we fear we won't be perfect at whatever it is that we're trying to do, so we'd rather not try at all. I get it, as a fellow perfectionist that's constantly working on that, I totally understand.  BUT sometimes we just need to do something different and out of our comfort zones to truly better ourselves.  Now when I say "invest in yourself" I don't necessarily mean only monetary ways, like professional development/workshops/educational purposes...though those are awesome! I also mean investing in things like your health, hobbies, relationships, etc.  Tune in to the episode to find out the 5 ways you can start investing in yourself today!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode13 Links mentioned:    SSR Podcast My interview on the SSR podcast Day in the Life of Alli Hoff Kosik, Freelance Writer Sign up for the Day in the Life newsletter    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about creativity and how it can make your life better.   Creativity was a topic that came a lot throughout my interview with Eric Lee of Left Field Labs both in the workplace and in life.   I think most people either label themselves as "creative" or "not creative" but in reality, everyone is creative in their own individual way.   Creativity is one of the most important characteristics of being human. A creative mind can enrich your life, making life so much more interesting instead of going aimlessly throughout your days. Being creative doesn't mean that you have to be an artist, maker, or creator of some sort...there are ways to be creative throughout your daily life and that's what we're going to cover in today's minisode!   I share a personal example of how I'm trying to creatively approach a new way thinking about how I spend my time and I'd love to hear your thoughts on creativity. Be sure to head on over to the Facebook group and join the conversation!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/creativity   Like the show? There are several ways you can help!

Hey hey happy minisode Friday! This week's interview with Nicholas Collins was a fun one and one thing we talked about a lot was social media and the presence it plays in kids lives.   As someone that started their career in social media, I've always had a weird relationship with it. Like, part of me loves it and it's brought me to some of my closest friends. It can definitely be used for inspiration and connection.   But the other part of me really struggles with it because I don't want to feel constantly tied to my phone and to be honest, I like having part of my life private. I don't want to share EVERYTHING about my life.   It's hard for me to completely disconnect because it is very tied to my job, but at times I do have to completely step away.   In today's minisode, I share reasons why we should ALL spend less time on social media and 3 tips on how you can limit your time.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com//less-time-social-media   Links mentioned:     Moment iPhone app  AntiSocial Android app    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're featuring a compilation of the best parts of people's days!   One question I ask every guest on the Day in the Life podcast is "what is the best part of your day." I think it's a great question to ask because it's a reminder that on most days, there is a highlight or something good or great happened. Of course we all have bad days, but I like to try and focus on the positive even when your day is subpar.   This compilation features a variety of past Day in the Life guests and what their best parts of their days are.   I hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/best-part-of-peoples-days   Links mentioned:    Day in the Life of Jacqueline Sutherland, Counterterrorism Expert Day in the Life of Elle Drouin, Styled Stock Photographer   Day in the Life of Andrew Crockford, Former U.S. Air Force Captain   Day in the Life of Lauren Frontiera, Founder of The Real Female Entrepreneur   Day in the Life of Lisa & Peter Hoppe, Full-time World Travelers   Day in the Life of DJ Martin, Broadway Advertiser Day in the Life of James Hinkle, Middle School Spanish Teacher   Day in the Life of Jyo Carolino, Fight Choreographer    Like the show?

On today's show, I have Haiyun Damon-Feng who is a Staff Attorney at KIND, which stands for Kids in Need of Defense.   Haiyun and I attended college together and lived in the same house and she had recently traveled to the Texas/Mexico border with KIND to speak with parents who had been detained and taken away from their children.   Haiyun shared her experience on her Facebook profile and this prompted me to ask her to come onto the podcast to share what a day in her life is like, what KIND does, what people misconstrue about refugee families, how she handles a career that is very emotionally and mentally taxing, what she struggles with the most and so much more.   At times this episode is gut wrenching but I think it's an important topic to discuss publicly, especially for those of us living in the States.   If you want to talk about this topic more with other listeners, I'd love to have you in the Day in the Life Facebook group.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/045 In today's episode, you'll find out:    How KIND helps unaccompanied children coming into the United States. What her experience was like recently visiting the border and speaking with parents who have been separated from their children. What people misconstrue about the refugee families and the children KIND helps. How she handles a career that is very emotionally taxing. The one thing she struggles with most in her career. Ways people can help refugee parents and children in need right now and how you can continuously help.    Links mentioned:    KIND Day in the Life of a Speechwriter    Follow Haiyun:    LinkedIn Instagram    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about budgeting! I was not always a budgeter, that's for sure. In fact, I really didn't start budgeting until about 6 years ago, when I was 24 years old.   There are plenty of ways to budget: some people prefer using apps, others prefer using a specific spreadsheet.   One thing that I've learned as an adult is that it's extremely important to plan ahead and budget. Budgeting is what allowed me to start my own business and get ahead at life.   In this episode, I share why budgeting is important and more importantly, how to get started!   Enjoy!   Full show notes at: how-i-budget   Links mentioned:    You Need a Budget Mint Every Dollar    Like the show?

I love hearing about people's morning routines. It's so interesting, because there's no one right way to conduct your morning.   Some Day in the Life guests wake up as early as 4am, others don't start until 10am. Some have a strict morning routine of writing in their 5 Minute Journal, others leisurely get up and see where the day takes them.   One main takeaway I've had over the past year of recording interviews is morning routines is specific to the individual. What works for one person might not work for another. And isn't that the beauty of life?   I compiled a variety of clips from past episodes talking about morning routines and my hope is that you get some inspiration to try something new for your morning routine.

Today's mini-sode we're talking about asking for help. Yes, I know how hard it is. But we have to start asking for help otherwise you're going to hit burnout (please, learn from my mistakes).   I've always had trouble asking for help, even from a young age. I've always felt this pressure to never ask for help, almost like it was a failure or weak to enlist someone else to help me, no matter what the task was.   It's difficult to ask for help because we fear rejection. We fear being seen as "less than" or "found out."   But ultimately, it's important to know where our strengths lie and where they don't. Sometimes, the most efficient way to move forward in life is to focus our efforts on what we do best, and leave the rest for someone else.   In this episode I share more about my struggles asking for help, research behind why it's so dang hard to ask for it, and 3 tips to help you...ask for help!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/how-to-ask-for-help   Links mentioned:     Why it’s hard to ask for help, Good Therapy  Why asking for help is so hard to do, Psychology Today  7 Effective Ways To Ask for Help, Psychology Today    Like the show?

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

This week I chatted with Emily Mills who is obviously a creative and artistic genius. I made it clear how much I lack the skills to draw or be artistic in any sort of way, but after last week's minisode about stopping myself from saying that I "can't" do something, I'm trying to change my language and how I speak about my drawing skills.

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-whats-something-that-you-feel-like-you-cant-do/id1292726596?i=1000431350062
This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.  Of course, this is perfectionism peeping it's ugly head into my subconscious again and I'm sure many of you may feel the same. It's uncomfortable to do new things but to quote marketing expert Seth Godin, "fear is a compass, not a barrier. It becomes a way to know what to do next, not an evil demon to be extinguished."Tune into this episode to find what you can do to start doing that one thing you feel like you "can't" do, but have always wanted to.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode28     Like the show?

Today's interview is special because it's another double interview! We haven't had one of those since interviewing World Travelers Lisa & Peter Hoppe. Anyways, I'm interviewing Sandy Connery & Jeni Barcelos who are the founders of a software company called Namastream.  Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome.

This week I chatted with  Professional Organizer Megan Mangione and it really got me thinking about stuff and why we hold on to it.  I researched a bit further into why we hold on to stuff, even when we feel cluttered, overwhelmed and disorganized. I'm definitely guilty of this and what I found through researching is exactly the reasons why I hold on to things.During this episode, I'm sharing what I found after diving into some research onto why we hold on to too much stuff and how I'm clearing out the physical and mental clutter in my life.

This week I chatted with  Professional Organizer Megan Mangione and it really got me thinking about stuff and why we hold on to it.  I researched a bit further into why we hold on to stuff, even when we feel cluttered, overwhelmed and disorganized. I'm definitely guilty of this and what I found through researching is exactly the reasons why I hold on to things.During this episode, I'm sharing what I found after diving into some research onto why we hold on to too much stuff and how I'm clearing out the physical and mental clutter in my life.

Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

First off, it's very difficult for me to "completely" turn off from any and all news as much of my career is based off of being on my computer/internet and being active on social media.  However, I have significantly reduced the amount of time I spend consuming the news, talking about the news, etc.  Tune in to find out why I did this, how it's significantly improved my life, and why you need to consider removing the negative from your life to.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode23 Links mentioned:    Natalie Bacon Natalie Bacon Instagram   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities. Tune in to find out the two ways I'm being more vulnerable in 2019, tips for how you can too, and my challenge on being more vulnerable.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode21 Links mentioned:    Setting fear aside minisode  Brene Brown’s TED Talk on vulnerability Daring Greatly by Brene Brown Day in the Life Facebook group   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello hello and welcome back to the Day in the Life podcast! Happy 2019 everyone!   I can't believe we are already halfway through the first month of 2019, so crazy! Anyways, before we get to today's episode, I wanted to share a few housekeeping updates before diving in. As most of you know, this podcast is a passion project of mine and not a primary way I make income. I was feeling really burnt out from all of the work I had taken on and taking a break was really good for me.   So, with that, we’ll be making some changes around here!   1) We're going to try something new for the podcast this year...we'll be doing seasons!Our "second" season will run January 15-April 2 and we will take a 6-week break in between before the third season starts.  I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

She’s helped me have a lot of business breakthroughs and I feel so fortunate to call her a friend.In addition to chatting about how she started Blush, we of course chat about a typical day in her life. She doesn’t stick to the traditional entrepreneur mindset of getting up at 5 am, which is a refreshing revelation as many people assume to run a successful business you have to be a morning person.Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    Why she's not a morning person and why she gave up coffee for good. How Blush came to be and how she pitched herself to a big company (and failed). How Blush works and who it's for. What Kali thinks people misconceive about being a life coach.

How Blush came to be and how she pitched herself to a big company (and failed). How Blush works and who it's for. What Kali thinks people misconceive about being a life coach.

Hey Day in the Life listeners! We're taking the rest of 2018 off from releasing new episodes but we wanted to share a few fan-favorite episodes in case you missed them the first time around. Enjoy!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Activist located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an activist.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

I feel like in today's society, it's pushed on us to figure out our "life's purpose" otherwise we're living up to our potential. The fact is, sometimes you're going through a time in your life when it's hard to know what your exact "purpose" is and that's totally okay! Tune in to hear my thoughts on the matter. I'd love to hear your thoughts too. Feel free to hit me up on Twitter or Instagram.

Today's minisode we're talking about the importance of investing in yourself.I think many of us fail to realize the value in investing in ourselves. Sometimes we use the excuse that we can't afford it, other times we use the excuse that we don't have time. But honestly, one of the absolute best things you can do for your well being AND for your wallet is to invest in yourself in some sort of way. I really think the reason why some of us don't "invest" in ourselves is that we fear we won't be perfect at whatever it is that we're trying to do, so we'd rather not try at all. I get it, as a fellow perfectionist that's constantly working on that, I totally understand.  BUT sometimes we just need to do something different and out of our comfort zones to truly better ourselves.  Now when I say "invest in yourself" I don't necessarily mean only monetary ways, like professional development/workshops/educational purposes...though those are awesome! I also mean investing in things like your health, hobbies, relationships, etc.  Tune in to the episode to find out the 5 ways you can start investing in yourself today!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode13 Links mentioned:    SSR Podcast My interview on the SSR podcast Day in the Life of Alli Hoff Kosik, Freelance Writer Sign up for the Day in the Life newsletter    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about creativity and how it can make your life better.   Creativity was a topic that came a lot throughout my interview with Eric Lee of Left Field Labs both in the workplace and in life.   I think most people either label themselves as "creative" or "not creative" but in reality, everyone is creative in their own individual way.   Creativity is one of the most important characteristics of being human. A creative mind can enrich your life, making life so much more interesting instead of going aimlessly throughout your days. Being creative doesn't mean that you have to be an artist, maker, or creator of some sort...there are ways to be creative throughout your daily life and that's what we're going to cover in today's minisode!   I share a personal example of how I'm trying to creatively approach a new way thinking about how I spend my time and I'd love to hear your thoughts on creativity. Be sure to head on over to the Facebook group and join the conversation!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/creativity   Like the show? There are several ways you can help!

Hey hey happy minisode Friday! This week's interview with Nicholas Collins was a fun one and one thing we talked about a lot was social media and the presence it plays in kids lives.   As someone that started their career in social media, I've always had a weird relationship with it. Like, part of me loves it and it's brought me to some of my closest friends. It can definitely be used for inspiration and connection.   But the other part of me really struggles with it because I don't want to feel constantly tied to my phone and to be honest, I like having part of my life private. I don't want to share EVERYTHING about my life.   It's hard for me to completely disconnect because it is very tied to my job, but at times I do have to completely step away.   In today's minisode, I share reasons why we should ALL spend less time on social media and 3 tips on how you can limit your time.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com//less-time-social-media   Links mentioned:     Moment iPhone app  AntiSocial Android app    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about budgeting! I was not always a budgeter, that's for sure. In fact, I really didn't start budgeting until about 6 years ago, when I was 24 years old.   There are plenty of ways to budget: some people prefer using apps, others prefer using a specific spreadsheet.   One thing that I've learned as an adult is that it's extremely important to plan ahead and budget. Budgeting is what allowed me to start my own business and get ahead at life.   In this episode, I share why budgeting is important and more importantly, how to get started!   Enjoy!   Full show notes at: how-i-budget   Links mentioned:    You Need a Budget Mint Every Dollar    Like the show?

Affiliate disclaimer: Heads up! There are affiliate links in these show notes. What that means is if you click on a link and then make a purchase, I make a small percentage of money because I referred you. This comes at no additional cost to you. I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Today's mini-sode we're talking about morning routines! I love hearing about people's morning routines. It's so interesting, because there's no one right way to conduct your morning.   Some Day in the Life guests wake up as early as 4am, others don't start until 10am. Some have a strict morning routine of writing in their 5 Minute Journal, others leisurely get up and see where the day takes them.   One main takeaway I've had over the past year of recording interviews is morning routines is specific to the individual.

I love hearing about people's morning routines. It's so interesting, because there's no one right way to conduct your morning.   Some Day in the Life guests wake up as early as 4am, others don't start until 10am. Some have a strict morning routine of writing in their 5 Minute Journal, others leisurely get up and see where the day takes them.   One main takeaway I've had over the past year of recording interviews is morning routines is specific to the individual. What works for one person might not work for another. And isn't that the beauty of life?   I compiled a variety of clips from past episodes talking about morning routines and my hope is that you get some inspiration to try something new for your morning routine.

Today's mini-sode we're talking about asking for help. Yes, I know how hard it is. But we have to start asking for help otherwise you're going to hit burnout (please, learn from my mistakes).   I've always had trouble asking for help, even from a young age. I've always felt this pressure to never ask for help, almost like it was a failure or weak to enlist someone else to help me, no matter what the task was.   It's difficult to ask for help because we fear rejection. We fear being seen as "less than" or "found out."   But ultimately, it's important to know where our strengths lie and where they don't. Sometimes, the most efficient way to move forward in life is to focus our efforts on what we do best, and leave the rest for someone else.   In this episode I share more about my struggles asking for help, research behind why it's so dang hard to ask for it, and 3 tips to help you...ask for help!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/how-to-ask-for-help   Links mentioned:     Why it’s hard to ask for help, Good Therapy  Why asking for help is so hard to do, Psychology Today  7 Effective Ways To Ask for Help, Psychology Today    Like the show?

Hence why I'm sharing my own experiences, thoughts, and advice on this mini-sode on how to take care of yourself.   This is something that I'm constantly balancing, so I'm no expert but if I can help one person out there I'll consider this a job well done.   If you feel you are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. It is a free, 24-hour hotline, at 1.800.273.TALK (8255). Your call will be connected to the crisis center nearest to you.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/take-care-of-yourself   Links mentioned:    Five Minute Journal  Jen Gotch is Okay...Sometimes podcast  Self-Service podcast Blush Online Life Coaching - use code dayinthelifepodcast for 25% off your first month of your subscription Talkspace    Like the show?

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-whats-something-that-you-feel-like-you-cant-do/id1292726596?i=1000431350062
This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.  Of course, this is perfectionism peeping it's ugly head into my subconscious again and I'm sure many of you may feel the same. It's uncomfortable to do new things but to quote marketing expert Seth Godin, "fear is a compass, not a barrier. It becomes a way to know what to do next, not an evil demon to be extinguished."Tune into this episode to find what you can do to start doing that one thing you feel like you "can't" do, but have always wanted to.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode28     Like the show?

Today's interview is special because it's another double interview! We haven't had one of those since interviewing World Travelers Lisa & Peter Hoppe. Anyways, I'm interviewing Sandy Connery & Jeni Barcelos who are the founders of a software company called Namastream.  Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome. Misconceptions about what it's like to work in the tech industry. Advice to young women who want to work in tech. What lights them up the most in their career as founders of a tech company.

This week I chatted with  Professional Organizer Megan Mangione and it really got me thinking about stuff and why we hold on to it.  I researched a bit further into why we hold on to stuff, even when we feel cluttered, overwhelmed and disorganized. I'm definitely guilty of this and what I found through researching is exactly the reasons why I hold on to things.During this episode, I'm sharing what I found after diving into some research onto why we hold on to too much stuff and how I'm clearing out the physical and mental clutter in my life.

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-other-peoples-perceptions-you-do-you-care/id1292726596?i=1000430382634
Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

However, I have significantly reduced the amount of time I spend consuming the news, talking about the news, etc.  Tune in to find out why I did this, how it's significantly improved my life, and why you need to consider removing the negative from your life to.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode23 Links mentioned:    Natalie Bacon Natalie Bacon Instagram   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities. Tune in to find out the two ways I'm being more vulnerable in 2019, tips for how you can too, and my challenge on being more vulnerable.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode21 Links mentioned:    Setting fear aside minisode  Brene Brown’s TED Talk on vulnerability Daring Greatly by Brene Brown Day in the Life Facebook group   Like the show?

Happy 2019 everyone!   I can't believe we are already halfway through the first month of 2019, so crazy! Anyways, before we get to today's episode, I wanted to share a few housekeeping updates before diving in. As most of you know, this podcast is a passion project of mine and not a primary way I make income. I was feeling really burnt out from all of the work I had taken on and taking a break was really good for me.   So, with that, we’ll be making some changes around here!   1) We're going to try something new for the podcast this year...we'll be doing seasons!Our "second" season will run January 15-April 2 and we will take a 6-week break in between before the third season starts.  I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

Hey Day in the Life listeners! We're taking the rest of 2018 off from releasing new episodes but we wanted to share a few fan-favorite episodes in case you missed them the first time around. Enjoy!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Activist located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an activist.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

  Today's minisode I'm sharing my thoughts on having a life purpose and what to do when you feel like you don't have one.  I feel like in today's society, it's pushed on us to figure out our "life's purpose" otherwise we're living up to our potential. The fact is, sometimes you're going through a time in your life when it's hard to know what your exact "purpose" is and that's totally okay! Tune in to hear my thoughts on the matter. I'd love to hear your thoughts too. Feel free to hit me up on Twitter or Instagram.

A common thread throughout many Day in the Life episodes is that we all don’t have enough time and that we all feel overwhelmed. Adding more ease and calmness into your daily life will help combat at least some of those feelings of overwhelm and perhaps even make your days flow more easily.

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-why-its-important-to-invest-in-yourself-5/id1292726596?i=1000420631094
Today's minisode we're talking about the importance of investing in yourself.I think many of us fail to realize the value in investing in ourselves. Sometimes we use the excuse that we can't afford it, other times we use the excuse that we don't have time. But honestly, one of the absolute best things you can do for your well being AND for your wallet is to invest in yourself in some sort of way. I really think the reason why some of us don't "invest" in ourselves is that we fear we won't be perfect at whatever it is that we're trying to do, so we'd rather not try at all. I get it, as a fellow perfectionist that's constantly working on that, I totally understand.  BUT sometimes we just need to do something different and out of our comfort zones to truly better ourselves.  Now when I say "invest in yourself" I don't necessarily mean only monetary ways, like professional development/workshops/educational purposes...though those are awesome! I also mean investing in things like your health, hobbies, relationships, etc.  Tune in to the episode to find out the 5 ways you can start investing in yourself today!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode13 Links mentioned:    SSR Podcast My interview on the SSR podcast Day in the Life of Alli Hoff Kosik, Freelance Writer Sign up for the Day in the Life newsletter    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about creativity and how it can make your life better.   Creativity was a topic that came a lot throughout my interview with Eric Lee of Left Field Labs both in the workplace and in life.   I think most people either label themselves as "creative" or "not creative" but in reality, everyone is creative in their own individual way.   Creativity is one of the most important characteristics of being human. A creative mind can enrich your life, making life so much more interesting instead of going aimlessly throughout your days. Being creative doesn't mean that you have to be an artist, maker, or creator of some sort...there are ways to be creative throughout your daily life and that's what we're going to cover in today's minisode!   I share a personal example of how I'm trying to creatively approach a new way thinking about how I spend my time and I'd love to hear your thoughts on creativity. Be sure to head on over to the Facebook group and join the conversation!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/creativity   Like the show? There are several ways you can help!

I LOVE teaching people how to be better at building relationships and I also love learning about it too.   (P.S.

If you want to learn how to cultivate authentic relationships with journalists, check out this free class I did with Day in the Life guest and freelance writer Alli Hoff Kosik.   So, during this week's minisode, I share two tips on how you can be better at building authentic relationships.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at:  http://brittneyllynn.com/build-authentic-relationships   Links mentioned:     Brene Brown Ted Talk on vulnerability Brene Brown's book, Daring Greatly    Like the show?

Hey hey happy minisode Friday! This week's interview with Nicholas Collins was a fun one and one thing we talked about a lot was social media and the presence it plays in kids lives.   As someone that started their career in social media, I've always had a weird relationship with it. Like, part of me loves it and it's brought me to some of my closest friends. It can definitely be used for inspiration and connection.   But the other part of me really struggles with it because I don't want to feel constantly tied to my phone and to be honest, I like having part of my life private. I don't want to share EVERYTHING about my life.   It's hard for me to completely disconnect because it is very tied to my job, but at times I do have to completely step away.   In today's minisode, I share reasons why we should ALL spend less time on social media and 3 tips on how you can limit your time.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com//less-time-social-media   Links mentioned:     Moment iPhone app  AntiSocial Android app    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about budgeting! I was not always a budgeter, that's for sure. In fact, I really didn't start budgeting until about 6 years ago, when I was 24 years old.   There are plenty of ways to budget: some people prefer using apps, others prefer using a specific spreadsheet.   One thing that I've learned as an adult is that it's extremely important to plan ahead and budget. Budgeting is what allowed me to start my own business and get ahead at life.   In this episode, I share why budgeting is important and more importantly, how to get started!   Enjoy!   Full show notes at: how-i-budget   Links mentioned:    You Need a Budget Mint Every Dollar    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about self motivation!   I've always been a self motivated person. I think part of has to do with being an only child and having to come up with ways to entertain myself, but also I think self motivation can be learned.   The people you surround yourself with and the content that you consume matters and can either increase or decrease your self motivation.   Many people have asked me what's kept me motivated to start my own business or even this podcast. My honest answer is that I feel I have a purpose bigger than me and that's what keeps me going.   During this mini-sode, I share my purpose in life with my PR business as well as the Day in the Life podcast. I also share 5 tips to help you become more self motivated.   Enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/self-motivation   Links mentioned:     Self Motivation Quiz    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about asking for help. Yes, I know how hard it is. But we have to start asking for help otherwise you're going to hit burnout (please, learn from my mistakes).   I've always had trouble asking for help, even from a young age. I've always felt this pressure to never ask for help, almost like it was a failure or weak to enlist someone else to help me, no matter what the task was.   It's difficult to ask for help because we fear rejection. We fear being seen as "less than" or "found out."   But ultimately, it's important to know where our strengths lie and where they don't. Sometimes, the most efficient way to move forward in life is to focus our efforts on what we do best, and leave the rest for someone else.   In this episode I share more about my struggles asking for help, research behind why it's so dang hard to ask for it, and 3 tips to help you...ask for help!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/how-to-ask-for-help   Links mentioned:     Why it’s hard to ask for help, Good Therapy  Why asking for help is so hard to do, Psychology Today  7 Effective Ways To Ask for Help, Psychology Today    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about following your passions and doing what you love most. I didn't really know what I wanted to do career-wise after graduating college but I quickly realized working in a traditional corporate 9-5 job wasn't for me.   I never really felt like I "fit in" in each of my corporate jobs and always knew there was something else I was meant to do but I had no idea what that was.   In this episode, I share questions you should ask yourself if you're trying to figure out exactly what your passion is, how to not get bogged down with the "hows" of following your passion, and my own experience figuring out what I was most passionate about.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/doing-what-you-love   Links mentioned:     How To Find Your Purpose in Life via Berkeley.edu    Like the show?

I didn't really know what I wanted to do career-wise after graduating college but I quickly realized working in a traditional corporate 9-5 job wasn't for me.   I never really felt like I "fit in" in each of my corporate jobs and always knew there was something else I was meant to do but I had no idea what that was.   In this episode, I share questions you should ask yourself if you're trying to figure out exactly what your passion is, how to not get bogged down with the "hows" of following your passion, and my own experience figuring out what I was most passionate about.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/doing-what-you-love   Links mentioned:     How To Find Your Purpose in Life via Berkeley.edu    Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/029-colt-keo-meier-clinical-psychologist-transgender/id1292726596?i=1000408573280
On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Advocate located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an advocate.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Advocate located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an advocate.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/027-barbara-parker-advocate-for-sensible-gun-legislation/id1292726596?i=1000407574116
Hi all. This week's episode has a little different format than the others, as we don't necessarily walk through someone's day like we normally do.   I got the opportunity to interview Barbara Parker, mother of Alison Parker who was a news reporter who was fatally shot on live television in 2015.   With the Parkland shooting happening a few months ago at the time of this recording, I felt it was important to share and educate listeners (and myself) on what it's like to be an advocate for sensible gun control.   Wherever your opinions lie on the spectrum of gun legislation I urge you to listen to this episode. We cover a lot of topics: What she means by her title as an advocate for sensible gun control, how her role as an activist has affected relationships in her life, how she was able to turn her grief into action, the biggest obstacles she faces while being an activist, what she would tell lawmakers and President Trump about gun control, and most importantly, actionable tips on how you can educate yourself on these issues and advocate for stricter gun laws.   As always, I'm very open to an honest, civil dialogue about any topic we talk about here on the Day in the Life podcast. If you want to share your thoughts on an episode or connect with other listeners, join our Facebook group to start a healthy discussion.   Honored that you're listening and thankful for the support.   In today's episode, you'll find out:    Definition of what an advocate for sensible gun legislation is. How her role as a gun control activist has effected her relationships. How she was able to turn her grief into action. What she would say to members leading the NRA about gun control. What she wishes people knew about being a gun control activist. The biggest obstacles she faces in her activism work. Her response to people when they say it's a mental health issue and not a gun control issue. How you can talk to friends and loved ones about gun control more openly. One thing she would tell lawmakers & President Trump about gun control. A moment that she feels her daughter would be most proud of during her activist work. Actionable steps people can take if they want to get more involved on enacting change with our current laws on gun control.    Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/027   Links mentioned:    Andy Parker's Facebook page (Barbara's husband) Everytown for Gun Safety Everytown for Gun Safety Facebook page Moms Demand Action Moms Demand Action Facebook page Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence Coalition to Stop Gun Violence Facebook page Honr Network    Like the show?

Grateful for your support!   On today's show, I have Paul Meier, who is a Former Lutheran Pastor located in Eastern Kentucky.  This episode is probably one of my favorites because our conversation took an unexpected turn. As Paul was talking about how he was led to work in ministry later in life, we discussed what later led him out of the ministry. One of those reasons was how his church congregation felt about homosexuality and Christianity.  I think our conversation will surprise and enlighten you and I hope no matter what you feel about this topic that you will open your heart and mind while you listen.Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How he got called to become a pastor later in life. How he emotionally handled being exposed to people's worst moments of their lives. If he ever experienced burnout. His thoughts on gay couples and Christianity.

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-whats-something-that-you-feel-like-you-cant-do/id1292726596?i=1000431350062
This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.  Of course, this is perfectionism peeping it's ugly head into my subconscious again and I'm sure many of you may feel the same. It's uncomfortable to do new things but to quote marketing expert Seth Godin, "fear is a compass, not a barrier. It becomes a way to know what to do next, not an evil demon to be extinguished."Tune into this episode to find what you can do to start doing that one thing you feel like you "can't" do, but have always wanted to.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode28     Like the show?

Today's interview is special because it's another double interview! We haven't had one of those since interviewing World Travelers Lisa & Peter Hoppe. Anyways, I'm interviewing Sandy Connery & Jeni Barcelos who are the founders of a software company called Namastream.  Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome. Misconceptions about what it's like to work in the tech industry. Advice to young women who want to work in tech. What lights them up the most in their career as founders of a tech company.

Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

Today's minisode we're talking about why I stopped following the news. Meg and I talked about social media and how she stopped sharing as much of her personal life on social media which led me to share how I've stopped paying attention to the news and I wanted to dive in deeper into this topic as I'm sure people have a variety of thoughts and feelings on this topic. First off, it's very difficult for me to "completely" turn off from any and all news as much of my career is based off of being on my computer/internet and being active on social media.  However, I have significantly reduced the amount of time I spend consuming the news, talking about the news, etc.  Tune in to find out why I did this, how it's significantly improved my life, and why you need to consider removing the negative from your life to.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode23 Links mentioned:    Natalie Bacon Natalie Bacon Instagram   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities. Tune in to find out the two ways I'm being more vulnerable in 2019, tips for how you can too, and my challenge on being more vulnerable.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode21 Links mentioned:    Setting fear aside minisode  Brene Brown’s TED Talk on vulnerability Daring Greatly by Brene Brown Day in the Life Facebook group   Like the show?

Happy 2019 everyone!   I can't believe we are already halfway through the first month of 2019, so crazy! Anyways, before we get to today's episode, I wanted to share a few housekeeping updates before diving in. As most of you know, this podcast is a passion project of mine and not a primary way I make income. I was feeling really burnt out from all of the work I had taken on and taking a break was really good for me.   So, with that, we’ll be making some changes around here!   1) We're going to try something new for the podcast this year...we'll be doing seasons!Our "second" season will run January 15-April 2 and we will take a 6-week break in between before the third season starts.  I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career.

I'm talkin' at least 8 years, which is a long time in blog days. While her blog has changed over time (it used to be healthy living focused, now it mostly shares what she's reading and writing), I've always loved following along her life.   I think I'm not alone when it comes to curiosity about what it's like to work at BuzzFeed. Is it really as fun as it seems? Are the people actually cool or are they stuck up? How do they get work done while working in a chaotic environment?!   We chat about all of this more.

Hey Day in the Life listeners! We're taking the rest of 2018 off from releasing new episodes but we wanted to share a few fan-favorite episodes in case you missed them the first time around. Enjoy!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Activist located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an activist.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

  Today's minisode I'm sharing my thoughts on having a life purpose and what to do when you feel like you don't have one.  I feel like in today's society, it's pushed on us to figure out our "life's purpose" otherwise we're living up to our potential. The fact is, sometimes you're going through a time in your life when it's hard to know what your exact "purpose" is and that's totally okay! Tune in to hear my thoughts on the matter. I'd love to hear your thoughts too. Feel free to hit me up on Twitter or Instagram.

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-why-its-important-to-invest-in-yourself-5/id1292726596?i=1000420631094
Today's minisode we're talking about the importance of investing in yourself.I think many of us fail to realize the value in investing in ourselves. Sometimes we use the excuse that we can't afford it, other times we use the excuse that we don't have time. But honestly, one of the absolute best things you can do for your well being AND for your wallet is to invest in yourself in some sort of way. I really think the reason why some of us don't "invest" in ourselves is that we fear we won't be perfect at whatever it is that we're trying to do, so we'd rather not try at all. I get it, as a fellow perfectionist that's constantly working on that, I totally understand.  BUT sometimes we just need to do something different and out of our comfort zones to truly better ourselves.  Now when I say "invest in yourself" I don't necessarily mean only monetary ways, like professional development/workshops/educational purposes...though those are awesome! I also mean investing in things like your health, hobbies, relationships, etc.  Tune in to the episode to find out the 5 ways you can start investing in yourself today!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode13 Links mentioned:    SSR Podcast My interview on the SSR podcast Day in the Life of Alli Hoff Kosik, Freelance Writer Sign up for the Day in the Life newsletter    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about creativity and how it can make your life better.   Creativity was a topic that came a lot throughout my interview with Eric Lee of Left Field Labs both in the workplace and in life.   I think most people either label themselves as "creative" or "not creative" but in reality, everyone is creative in their own individual way.   Creativity is one of the most important characteristics of being human. A creative mind can enrich your life, making life so much more interesting instead of going aimlessly throughout your days. Being creative doesn't mean that you have to be an artist, maker, or creator of some sort...there are ways to be creative throughout your daily life and that's what we're going to cover in today's minisode!   I share a personal example of how I'm trying to creatively approach a new way thinking about how I spend my time and I'd love to hear your thoughts on creativity. Be sure to head on over to the Facebook group and join the conversation!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/creativity   Like the show? There are several ways you can help!

Hey hey happy minisode Friday! This week's interview with Nicholas Collins was a fun one and one thing we talked about a lot was social media and the presence it plays in kids lives.   As someone that started their career in social media, I've always had a weird relationship with it. Like, part of me loves it and it's brought me to some of my closest friends. It can definitely be used for inspiration and connection.   But the other part of me really struggles with it because I don't want to feel constantly tied to my phone and to be honest, I like having part of my life private. I don't want to share EVERYTHING about my life.   It's hard for me to completely disconnect because it is very tied to my job, but at times I do have to completely step away.   In today's minisode, I share reasons why we should ALL spend less time on social media and 3 tips on how you can limit your time.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com//less-time-social-media   Links mentioned:     Moment iPhone app  AntiSocial Android app    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about budgeting! I was not always a budgeter, that's for sure. In fact, I really didn't start budgeting until about 6 years ago, when I was 24 years old.   There are plenty of ways to budget: some people prefer using apps, others prefer using a specific spreadsheet.   One thing that I've learned as an adult is that it's extremely important to plan ahead and budget. Budgeting is what allowed me to start my own business and get ahead at life.   In this episode, I share why budgeting is important and more importantly, how to get started!   Enjoy!   Full show notes at: how-i-budget   Links mentioned:    You Need a Budget Mint Every Dollar    Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Today's mini-sode we're talking about morning routines! I love hearing about people's morning routines. It's so interesting, because there's no one right way to conduct your morning.   Some Day in the Life guests wake up as early as 4am, others don't start until 10am. Some have a strict morning routine of writing in their 5 Minute Journal, others leisurely get up and see where the day takes them.   One main takeaway I've had over the past year of recording interviews is morning routines is specific to the individual. What works for one person might not work for another. And isn't that the beauty of life?   I compiled a variety of clips from past episodes talking about morning routines and my hope is that you get some inspiration to try something new for your morning routine. Or maybe you'll realize morning routines aren't your thing and that's okay too!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/morning-routines   Links mentioned:    5 Minute Journal Day in the Life of Tonya Dalton, Productivity expert Day in the Life of Kali Rogers, CEO of Blush Online Coaching Day in the Life of Sarah Bruggeman, Pastry Chef Day in the Life of John Hubbard, Cyber Security Manager Day in the Life of Daron Roberts, Former NFL Coach Day in the Life of Mojan Nourbakhsh, Hollywood Actress Day in the Life of Jordan Gill, Business Operations Consultant  Miracle Morning book by Hal Elrod Miracle Morning podcast    Like the show?

I love hearing about people's morning routines. It's so interesting, because there's no one right way to conduct your morning.   Some Day in the Life guests wake up as early as 4am, others don't start until 10am. Some have a strict morning routine of writing in their 5 Minute Journal, others leisurely get up and see where the day takes them.   One main takeaway I've had over the past year of recording interviews is morning routines is specific to the individual. What works for one person might not work for another. And isn't that the beauty of life?   I compiled a variety of clips from past episodes talking about morning routines and my hope is that you get some inspiration to try something new for your morning routine. Or maybe you'll realize morning routines aren't your thing and that's okay too!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/morning-routines   Links mentioned:    5 Minute Journal Day in the Life of Tonya Dalton, Productivity expert Day in the Life of Kali Rogers, CEO of Blush Online Coaching Day in the Life of Sarah Bruggeman, Pastry Chef Day in the Life of John Hubbard, Cyber Security Manager Day in the Life of Daron Roberts, Former NFL Coach Day in the Life of Mojan Nourbakhsh, Hollywood Actress Day in the Life of Jordan Gill, Business Operations Consultant  Miracle Morning book by Hal Elrod Miracle Morning podcast    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about asking for help. Yes, I know how hard it is. But we have to start asking for help otherwise you're going to hit burnout (please, learn from my mistakes).   I've always had trouble asking for help, even from a young age. I've always felt this pressure to never ask for help, almost like it was a failure or weak to enlist someone else to help me, no matter what the task was.   It's difficult to ask for help because we fear rejection. We fear being seen as "less than" or "found out."   But ultimately, it's important to know where our strengths lie and where they don't. Sometimes, the most efficient way to move forward in life is to focus our efforts on what we do best, and leave the rest for someone else.   In this episode I share more about my struggles asking for help, research behind why it's so dang hard to ask for it, and 3 tips to help you...ask for help!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/how-to-ask-for-help   Links mentioned:     Why it’s hard to ask for help, Good Therapy  Why asking for help is so hard to do, Psychology Today  7 Effective Ways To Ask for Help, Psychology Today    Like the show?

On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Advocate located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an advocate.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide.

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/027-barbara-parker-advocate-for-sensible-gun-legislation/id1292726596?i=1000407574116
Hi all. This week's episode has a little different format than the others, as we don't necessarily walk through someone's day like we normally do.   I got the opportunity to interview Barbara Parker, mother of Alison Parker who was a news reporter who was fatally shot on live television in 2015.   With the Parkland shooting happening a few months ago at the time of this recording, I felt it was important to share and educate listeners (and myself) on what it's like to be an advocate for sensible gun control.   Wherever your opinions lie on the spectrum of gun legislation I urge you to listen to this episode. We cover a lot of topics: What she means by her title as an advocate for sensible gun control, how her role as an activist has affected relationships in her life, how she was able to turn her grief into action, the biggest obstacles she faces while being an activist, what she would tell lawmakers and President Trump about gun control, and most importantly, actionable tips on how you can educate yourself on these issues and advocate for stricter gun laws.   As always, I'm very open to an honest, civil dialogue about any topic we talk about here on the Day in the Life podcast.

Hi all. This week's episode has a little different format than the others, as we don't necessarily walk through someone's day like we normally do.   I got the opportunity to interview Barbara Parker, mother of Alison Parker who was a news reporter who was fatally shot on live television in 2015.   With the Parkland shooting happening a few months ago at the time of this recording, I felt it was important to share and educate listeners (and myself) on what it's like to be an advocate for sensible gun control.   Wherever your opinions lie on the spectrum of gun legislation I urge you to listen to this episode. We cover a lot of topics: What she means by her title as an advocate for sensible gun control, how her role as an activist has affected relationships in her life, how she was able to turn her grief into action, the biggest obstacles she faces while being an activist, what she would tell lawmakers and President Trump about gun control, and most importantly, actionable tips on how you can educate yourself on these issues and advocate for stricter gun laws.   As always, I'm very open to an honest, civil dialogue about any topic we talk about here on the Day in the Life podcast.

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

This week I chatted with Emily Mills who is obviously a creative and artistic genius. I made it clear how much I lack the skills to draw or be artistic in any sort of way, but after last week's minisode about stopping myself from saying that I "can't" do something, I'm trying to change my language and how I speak about my drawing skills.  I then started looking into how drawing can positively impact your days -- and boy, I found a lot of research on this!  Tune in to find out how drawing can boost your mood and positively impact your day to day life!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode29 Links mentioned:    Day in the Life Minisode - What's Something You Feel Like You Can't Do  Psychology Today - Drawing is a Simple Way to Improve Your Mood  Very Well Mind - What is Art Therapy  Very Well Mind - How To Relieve Stress with Art Therapy   Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-whats-something-that-you-feel-like-you-cant-do/id1292726596?i=1000431350062
This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.  Of course, this is perfectionism peeping it's ugly head into my subconscious again and I'm sure many of you may feel the same. It's uncomfortable to do new things but to quote marketing expert Seth Godin, "fear is a compass, not a barrier. It becomes a way to know what to do next, not an evil demon to be extinguished."Tune into this episode to find what you can do to start doing that one thing you feel like you "can't" do, but have always wanted to.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode28     Like the show?

Today's interview is special because it's another double interview! We haven't had one of those since interviewing World Travelers Lisa & Peter Hoppe. Anyways, I'm interviewing Sandy Connery & Jeni Barcelos who are the founders of a software company called Namastream.  Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome. Misconceptions about what it's like to work in the tech industry. Advice to young women who want to work in tech. What lights them up the most in their career as founders of a tech company.

Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

Today's minisode we're talking about why I stopped following the news.

First off, it's very difficult for me to "completely" turn off from any and all news as much of my career is based off of being on my computer/internet and being active on social media.  However, I have significantly reduced the amount of time I spend consuming the news, talking about the news, etc.  Tune in to find out why I did this, how it's significantly improved my life, and why you need to consider removing the negative from your life to.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode23 Links mentioned:    Natalie Bacon Natalie Bacon Instagram   Like the show?

Affiliate disclaimer: Heads up! There are affiliate links in this blog post. What that means is if you click on a link and then make a purchase, I make a small percentage of money because I referred you. This comes at no additional cost to you. I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities.

Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities. Tune in to find out the two ways I'm being more vulnerable in 2019, tips for how you can too, and my challenge on being more vulnerable.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode21 Links mentioned:    Setting fear aside minisode  Brene Brown’s TED Talk on vulnerability Daring Greatly by Brene Brown Day in the Life Facebook group   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello hello and welcome back to the Day in the Life podcast! Happy 2019 everyone!   I can't believe we are already halfway through the first month of 2019, so crazy! Anyways, before we get to today's episode, I wanted to share a few housekeeping updates before diving in. As most of you know, this podcast is a passion project of mine and not a primary way I make income. I was feeling really burnt out from all of the work I had taken on and taking a break was really good for me.   So, with that, we’ll be making some changes around here!   1) We're going to try something new for the podcast this year...we'll be doing seasons!Our "second" season will run January 15-April 2 and we will take a 6-week break in between before the third season starts.  I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

Hey Day in the Life listeners! We're taking the rest of 2018 off from releasing new episodes but we wanted to share a few fan-favorite episodes in case you missed them the first time around. Enjoy!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Activist located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an activist.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

  Today's minisode I'm sharing my thoughts on having a life purpose and what to do when you feel like you don't have one.  I feel like in today's society, it's pushed on us to figure out our "life's purpose" otherwise we're living up to our potential. The fact is, sometimes you're going through a time in your life when it's hard to know what your exact "purpose" is and that's totally okay! Tune in to hear my thoughts on the matter. I'd love to hear your thoughts too. Feel free to hit me up on Twitter or Instagram.

Grateful for your support!   Today's minisode we're talking about adding more ease and calmness into your daily life. This week’s interview with Katie Kritmosis was so, so fun for me and it made me realize that I could definitely stand to add more calming, meditative moments throughout my days. A common thread throughout many Day in the Life episodes is that we all don’t have enough time and that we all feel overwhelmed. Adding more ease and calmness into your daily life will help combat at least some of those feelings of overwhelm and perhaps even make your days flow more easily. I’d like to share 6 ways how I’ve been adding more ease and calmness throughout my days and hopefully they’ll help you!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/014 Links mentioned:    Day in the Life of Tonya Dalton, Productivity expert Calm Magnesium drink Kava Stress Relief Tea Natalie Bacon   Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-why-its-important-to-invest-in-yourself-5/id1292726596?i=1000420631094
Today's minisode we're talking about the importance of investing in yourself.I think many of us fail to realize the value in investing in ourselves. Sometimes we use the excuse that we can't afford it, other times we use the excuse that we don't have time. But honestly, one of the absolute best things you can do for your well being AND for your wallet is to invest in yourself in some sort of way. I really think the reason why some of us don't "invest" in ourselves is that we fear we won't be perfect at whatever it is that we're trying to do, so we'd rather not try at all. I get it, as a fellow perfectionist that's constantly working on that, I totally understand.  BUT sometimes we just need to do something different and out of our comfort zones to truly better ourselves.  Now when I say "invest in yourself" I don't necessarily mean only monetary ways, like professional development/workshops/educational purposes...though those are awesome! I also mean investing in things like your health, hobbies, relationships, etc.  Tune in to the episode to find out the 5 ways you can start investing in yourself today!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode13 Links mentioned:    SSR Podcast My interview on the SSR podcast Day in the Life of Alli Hoff Kosik, Freelance Writer Sign up for the Day in the Life newsletter    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about creativity and how it can make your life better.   Creativity was a topic that came a lot throughout my interview with Eric Lee of Left Field Labs both in the workplace and in life.   I think most people either label themselves as "creative" or "not creative" but in reality, everyone is creative in their own individual way.   Creativity is one of the most important characteristics of being human. A creative mind can enrich your life, making life so much more interesting instead of going aimlessly throughout your days. Being creative doesn't mean that you have to be an artist, maker, or creator of some sort...there are ways to be creative throughout your daily life and that's what we're going to cover in today's minisode!   I share a personal example of how I'm trying to creatively approach a new way thinking about how I spend my time and I'd love to hear your thoughts on creativity. Be sure to head on over to the Facebook group and join the conversation!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/creativity   Like the show? There are several ways you can help!

Hey hey happy minisode Friday! This week's interview with Nicholas Collins was a fun one and one thing we talked about a lot was social media and the presence it plays in kids lives.   As someone that started their career in social media, I've always had a weird relationship with it. Like, part of me loves it and it's brought me to some of my closest friends. It can definitely be used for inspiration and connection.   But the other part of me really struggles with it because I don't want to feel constantly tied to my phone and to be honest, I like having part of my life private. I don't want to share EVERYTHING about my life.   It's hard for me to completely disconnect because it is very tied to my job, but at times I do have to completely step away.   In today's minisode, I share reasons why we should ALL spend less time on social media and 3 tips on how you can limit your time.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com//less-time-social-media   Links mentioned:     Moment iPhone app  AntiSocial Android app    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about budgeting! I was not always a budgeter, that's for sure.

Budgeting is what allowed me to start my own business and get ahead at life.   In this episode, I share why budgeting is important and more importantly, how to get started!   Enjoy!   Full show notes at: how-i-budget   Links mentioned:    You Need a Budget Mint Every Dollar    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about asking for help. Yes, I know how hard it is. But we have to start asking for help otherwise you're going to hit burnout (please, learn from my mistakes).   I've always had trouble asking for help, even from a young age. I've always felt this pressure to never ask for help, almost like it was a failure or weak to enlist someone else to help me, no matter what the task was.   It's difficult to ask for help because we fear rejection. We fear being seen as "less than" or "found out."   But ultimately, it's important to know where our strengths lie and where they don't. Sometimes, the most efficient way to move forward in life is to focus our efforts on what we do best, and leave the rest for someone else.   In this episode I share more about my struggles asking for help, research behind why it's so dang hard to ask for it, and 3 tips to help you...ask for help!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/how-to-ask-for-help   Links mentioned:     Why it’s hard to ask for help, Good Therapy  Why asking for help is so hard to do, Psychology Today  7 Effective Ways To Ask for Help, Psychology Today    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about following your passions and doing what you love most. I didn't really know what I wanted to do career-wise after graduating college but I quickly realized working in a traditional corporate 9-5 job wasn't for me.   I never really felt like I "fit in" in each of my corporate jobs and always knew there was something else I was meant to do but I had no idea what that was.   In this episode, I share questions you should ask yourself if you're trying to figure out exactly what your passion is, how to not get bogged down with the "hows" of following your passion, and my own experience figuring out what I was most passionate about.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/doing-what-you-love   Links mentioned:     How To Find Your Purpose in Life via Berkeley.edu    Like the show?

On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Advocate located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an advocate.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/027-barbara-parker-advocate-for-sensible-gun-legislation/id1292726596?i=1000407574116
Hi all. This week's episode has a little different format than the others, as we don't necessarily walk through someone's day like we normally do.   I got the opportunity to interview Barbara Parker, mother of Alison Parker who was a news reporter who was fatally shot on live television in 2015.   With the Parkland shooting happening a few months ago at the time of this recording, I felt it was important to share and educate listeners (and myself) on what it's like to be an advocate for sensible gun control.   Wherever your opinions lie on the spectrum of gun legislation I urge you to listen to this episode. We cover a lot of topics: What she means by her title as an advocate for sensible gun control, how her role as an activist has affected relationships in her life, how she was able to turn her grief into action, the biggest obstacles she faces while being an activist, what she would tell lawmakers and President Trump about gun control, and most importantly, actionable tips on how you can educate yourself on these issues and advocate for stricter gun laws.   As always, I'm very open to an honest, civil dialogue about any topic we talk about here on the Day in the Life podcast. If you want to share your thoughts on an episode or connect with other listeners, join our Facebook group to start a healthy discussion.   Honored that you're listening and thankful for the support.   In today's episode, you'll find out:    Definition of what an advocate for sensible gun legislation is. How her role as a gun control activist has effected her relationships. How she was able to turn her grief into action. What she would say to members leading the NRA about gun control. What she wishes people knew about being a gun control activist. The biggest obstacles she faces in her activism work. Her response to people when they say it's a mental health issue and not a gun control issue. How you can talk to friends and loved ones about gun control more openly. One thing she would tell lawmakers & President Trump about gun control. A moment that she feels her daughter would be most proud of during her activist work. Actionable steps people can take if they want to get more involved on enacting change with our current laws on gun control.    Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/027   Links mentioned:    Andy Parker's Facebook page (Barbara's husband) Everytown for Gun Safety Everytown for Gun Safety Facebook page Moms Demand Action Moms Demand Action Facebook page Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence Coalition to Stop Gun Violence Facebook page Honr Network    Like the show?

Advice she would give to someone who wants to work in journalism or at BuzzFeed specifically. The most challenging aspects and proudest moments during her career at BuzzFeed. One thing that surprised her about working at BuzzFeed. Where she finds inspiration for the articles she writes and what she likes most about working at BuzzFeed.

On today's show, I have Elle Drouin, Product Stylist Photographer & Insta-Famous Pet Owner, who's located in New York City. Elle was one of my first business friends who I found on, you guessed it, Instagram. We've partnered together on several projects and hang in the same online business groups and she's such a fun person to know! Obviously I had to have someone on that owns a Insta-famous pet because I know there's a LOT of you out there that either 1) are really curious about this and want to start your own Instagram for your beloved pet or 2) are totally clueless about this world and are intrigued at learning more. Elle and I chat about her background in finance and how it led her to start her own business, how she grew her dog Mochi's Instagram account strategically, the weird requests she gets, and her biggest struggle she has managing both businesses. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    Elle (and Mochi's) morning routine. Elle's background in finance and how it led her to start her own business. How & why she started Mochi's Instagram account and how she grew it strategically. How she determines what Mochi's audience wants to see on Instagram. Her advice for those who want to grow an Instagram account authentically. Why she decided to start her own styled stock photography business. If she feels pressure to make everything in her Instagram feed look perfect all of the time. How she batches her project tasks and the tools she uses to stay organized. Elle's favorite partnership Mochi was a part of. The weirdest request Elle's gotten for a brand collaboration with Mochi. How much does Mochi gets paid per sponsorship. The biggest struggle she has running her business and Mochi's account. Which Bravo celebrity Mochi is most like.

Katie Hunt of Tradeshow Bootcamp was one of my first PR clients that I started working with late last year and I’m so honored to be a part of her incredible team. If you aren’t familiar Katie, Tradeshow Bootcamp offers educational workshops (both online and in person!) to creative entrepreneurs who want to learn how to sell wholesale, exhibit at tradeshows, and learn about a variety of business topics. She’s coached over 700 brands, some of who have products in Anthropologie, Hallmark, Target, and more. The TSBC alumni community and the support they have for one another is exceptional and I feel super lucky to get to be a part of it. In today’s episode, you'll find out:  Why she doesn't schedule meetings before 10am. How her and her husband tag team the mornings. How she went from working in her corporate job in the law industry to work in the creative entrepreneur space selling stationery on Etsy. How Tradeshow Bootcamp came to be and what motivated her to start this business. How she keeps track of all of the moving pieces of her business. The moment she felt ready enough to finally leave her full-time corporate job and take her business full-time. Why she doesn't outsource her social media management for the TSBC brand. One of her biggest struggles she's had running a business and being an entrepreneur. Her fears about outsourcing and hiring a team. A big misconception people have about being an entrepreneur. Decision fatigue and how it affects you as a business owner. What she's the most proud of from building TSBC.

Ever wonder what a day in the life is like for an Online Life Coach? Now’s your chance! Kali Rogers of Blush Online Life Coaching was one of my first business BFFs and now good friend and client. Kali’s story of how she started her business is so inspiring to me and I love her witty personality and generous demeanor. She’s helped me have a lot of business breakthroughs and I feel so fortunate to call her a friend. In addition to chatting about how she started Blush, we of course chat about a typical day in her life. She doesn’t stick to the traditional entrepreneur mindset of getting up at 5 am, which is a refreshing revelation as many people assume to run a successful business you have to be a morning person. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy! In today’s episode, you'll find out:  Why she's not a morning person and why she gave up coffee for good. How Blush came to be and how she pitched herself to a big company (and failed). How Blush works and who it's for. What Kali thinks people misconceive about being a life coach. What the difference between life coaching and counseling is and the stigmas behind each. Why Kali hates having her day completely planned out ahead of time and why setting intentions works best for her. Why Kali doesn't formally "exercise" and walks instead.

In addition to chatting about how she started Blush, we of course chat about a typical day in her life. She doesn’t stick to the traditional entrepreneur mindset of getting up at 5 am, which is a refreshing revelation as many people assume to run a successful business you have to be a morning person. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy! In today’s episode, you'll find out:  Why she's not a morning person and why she gave up coffee for good. How Blush came to be and how she pitched herself to a big company (and failed). How Blush works and who it's for. What Kali thinks people misconceive about being a life coach. What the difference between life coaching and counseling is and the stigmas behind each. Why Kali hates having her day completely planned out ahead of time and why setting intentions works best for her. Why Kali doesn't formally "exercise" and walks instead.

I have to admit, talking with Andrew was one of the most fun conversations I’ve been able to record thus far. He was just so easy to talk to, it felt like we had been longtime friends. Anyways, Andrew shares a lot of the juicy scoop on what it was really like to work for one of the biggest Hollywood agencies in the world, William Morris Endeavor (WME). If you are familiar with the popular show Entourage, Andrew was basically like a real-life Lloyd (Ari Gold’s assistant). As a super fan of that show, you can imagine my excitement at getting the inside scoop. Andrew shares the good and the bad of working in entertainment and what he’s up to these days. Hope you enjoy!

This week I chatted with Sean Sublette who is a meteorologist and I loved his simple advice on how we can all make a big impact on our environment by making small changes in our daily lives. When it comes to making a difference with the effects on our environment, it can seem like a huge daunting task and that there's no way minor changes can't help but that's so not the case! Every little bit adds up and it can add up to massive change.  While I do feel like I'm already doing a lot to help conserve energy (we have a smart thermostat, energy efficient appliances, use LED lights) there's always more I can do so I want this week's challenge to be all about conserving more energy and reducing my consumption!   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode30   Like the show?

I made it clear how much I lack the skills to draw or be artistic in any sort of way, but after last week's minisode about stopping myself from saying that I "can't" do something, I'm trying to change my language and how I speak about my drawing skills.

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-whats-something-that-you-feel-like-you-cant-do/id1292726596?i=1000431350062
This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.

This week I chatted with Sandy and Jeni from Namastream and our conversation got me thinking about how people approach things they feel like they "can't" do. It was eye-opening to me that neither Sandy nor Jeni had a software engineering background, yet here they are, creating an incredible software company.  Like, have you told yourself your entire life that you "can't" do something for one reason or another? I know I have.  I've told myself "I'm not athletic" "I can't draw" "I'm not smart enough/experienced enough to do XYZ" While I'm certainly not going to be the next Michael Jordan or Picasso, I can, in fact do some of these things, I just don't try because I won't be the best or the expert at it.

Today's interview is special because it's another double interview! We haven't had one of those since interviewing World Travelers Lisa & Peter Hoppe. Anyways, I'm interviewing Sandy Connery & Jeni Barcelos who are the founders of a software company called Namastream.  Sandy & Jeni did NOT have software engineering backgrounds at all when they started Namastream and as two female founders of a tech company, I thought it'd be great to get their insight on their struggles, successes and a peek inside what it's really like to run a software company. We chat about the major challenges bootstrapping a tech company (they did not get venture capital funding), the specific challenges facing female entrepreneurs in tech, the biggest barriers they've had to overcome, misconceptions people have about working in the tech industry, advice to young women who want to work in tech and so much more.  As always, you can join in the conversation with other Day in the Life listeners in the Day in the Life Facebook group!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    The major challenges of bootstrappng a tech company with no venture capital funding. Why they ultimately decided to not seek out venture capital funding. The specific challenges female entrepreneurs in tech face. The biggest barriers they've had to overcome. Misconceptions about what it's like to work in the tech industry. Advice to young women who want to work in tech. What lights them up the most in their career as founders of a tech company.

Today's minisode we're talking about other people's perceptions and if you care too much. This week's interview with exotic dancer Demiana may have been a polarizing one for you guys, but I wanted to continue the conversation by talking about other people's perceptions of you and if you care too much. Here's the thing: we all to some degree, for the most part, compare ourselves to other people. It's a natural, human thing to do. It's also natural to care about what other people think about you. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to some degree it helps you be self-aware which I think is an important quality in people.  But for a lot of us, we can care way too much about what other people think about us. And during my interview with Demiana and her sharing about what her friends and family thought about her career it got me thinking more on this topic.  I for one am guilty of caring way too much what other's think about me. I'm a people pleaser through and through and have struggled with this my entire life. Tune in to learn how to know if other people's perceptions are affecting your life too much and what to do about it.   Full show notes at: http://dayinthelifepodcast.com/minisode26   Like the show?

Today's minisode we're talking about why I stopped following the news. Meg and I talked about social media and how she stopped sharing as much of her personal life on social media which led me to share how I've stopped paying attention to the news and I wanted to dive in deeper into this topic as I'm sure people have a variety of thoughts and feelings on this topic. First off, it's very difficult for me to "completely" turn off from any and all news as much of my career is based off of being on my computer/internet and being active on social media.  However, I have significantly reduced the amount of time I spend consuming the news, talking about the news, etc.  Tune in to find out why I did this, how it's significantly improved my life, and why you need to consider removing the negative from your life to.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode23 Links mentioned:    Natalie Bacon Natalie Bacon Instagram   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello, hello and we are back from our winter break with the first minisode of 2019 and we are starting with a bang by talking about vulnerability. We've touched a little on this in a past minisode about setting fear aside but I want to talk more specifically about vulnerability as that was a topic we discussed thoroughly during this week's interview with Alexis Teichmiller. Being vulnerable is hard for me, like it is for almost anyone else. The reasons why it's hard for me is because I don't like being seen as weak or like I can't do something or that I don't know what I'm doing. I think most people have those fears or similar fears so even though I know I'm not alone in those feelings...being vulnerable is still hard. Nobody likes the feeling of rejection. Nobody likes the feeling of loneliness.But it's interesting, because when people are most vulnerable, we celebrate their strength. We love seeing others be so raw, honest and open but it's still difficult for us to be comfortable with sharing our own vulnerabilities. Tune in to find out the two ways I'm being more vulnerable in 2019, tips for how you can too, and my challenge on being more vulnerable.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode21 Links mentioned:    Setting fear aside minisode  Brene Brown’s TED Talk on vulnerability Daring Greatly by Brene Brown Day in the Life Facebook group   Like the show?

I only share products and resources that I trust and that I know will help you in your business. Grateful for your support!   Hello hello and welcome back to the Day in the Life podcast! Happy 2019 everyone!   I can't believe we are already halfway through the first month of 2019, so crazy! Anyways, before we get to today's episode, I wanted to share a few housekeeping updates before diving in. As most of you know, this podcast is a passion project of mine and not a primary way I make income. I was feeling really burnt out from all of the work I had taken on and taking a break was really good for me.   So, with that, we’ll be making some changes around here!   1) We're going to try something new for the podcast this year...we'll be doing seasons!Our "second" season will run January 15-April 2 and we will take a 6-week break in between before the third season starts.  I have some fun plans for the mini-breaks though so you aren't left with no new content :)2) Minisodes will still be happening on Fridays and I'm hoping to make them more action & value-packed.  I want us all to be challenged on how we can improve our days, whether it's physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc and I want to use these minisodes to motivate and challenge you (and me!)  3) I've decided to launch a YouTube account! I've talked about this with countless people, some even in this group, and I'm committing to making it happen this year.My biggest hesitation around starting a YouTube account for the Day in the Life has been my fear of putting it all out there.Ya see, if I'm sharing what my daily life is like, I have to share the good AND the bad AND the ugly. And that intimidates me but I'm willing myself to push past that and show up...no matter what.I haven't decided an exact date of launch yet but it's coming...and I'm putting it here so you guys can keep me accountable.SO! Now that that's out of the way... let's get to today's episode!   Today's interview is with Alexis Teichmiller who is the ConvertKit Affiliate Manager. (Don't worry, if you don't know what an affiliate manager is Alexis shares exactly what that is!) Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

Most interestingly though, I wanted to bring on Alexis because she has made it a point to share vulnerable things about your life, your relationships, your struggles, anxiety, etc on social media.   She shares why this is important to her, how other people can start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities, what "image management" is, as well as what it's like to work for a completely remote company, and how she prioritizes her side hustle passions alongside a full-time job.  Guys, I compared her to Brene Brown during the episode because she is just THAT GOOD. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How Alexis got started working for ConvertKit. Why it's important to Alexis to share not only the great parts of her life but also the vulnerable parts of her life, her relationships, and anxiety. What image management is and why we need to let it go. Her tips on how other people start to feel more comfortable with sharing their vulnerabilities. The best part about working at ConverKit and her experience working for a completely remote company. How she prioritizes her side hustle passions and a full time job plus advice she would give others who want to do the same. Her biggest struggles and misconceptions about her career. Her 3 non-negotiable travel items she can't live without.   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/057 Links mentioned:    ConvertKit

Hey Day in the Life listeners! We're taking the rest of 2018 off from releasing new episodes but we wanted to share a few fan-favorite episodes in case you missed them the first time around. Enjoy!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Activist located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an activist.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

  Today's minisode I'm sharing my thoughts on having a life purpose and what to do when you feel like you don't have one.  I feel like in today's society, it's pushed on us to figure out our "life's purpose" otherwise we're living up to our potential. The fact is, sometimes you're going through a time in your life when it's hard to know what your exact "purpose" is and that's totally okay! Tune in to hear my thoughts on the matter.

Grateful for your support!   Today's minisode we're talking about adding more ease and calmness into your daily life. This week’s interview with Katie Kritmosis was so, so fun for me and it made me realize that I could definitely stand to add more calming, meditative moments throughout my days. A common thread throughout many Day in the Life episodes is that we all don’t have enough time and that we all feel overwhelmed. Adding more ease and calmness into your daily life will help combat at least some of those feelings of overwhelm and perhaps even make your days flow more easily. I’d like to share 6 ways how I’ve been adding more ease and calmness throughout my days and hopefully they’ll help you!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/014 Links mentioned:    Day in the Life of Tonya Dalton, Productivity expert Calm Magnesium drink Kava Stress Relief Tea Natalie Bacon   Like the show?

Today's minisode we're talking about the importance of investing in yourself.I think many of us fail to realize the value in investing in ourselves. Sometimes we use the excuse that we can't afford it, other times we use the excuse that we don't have time. But honestly, one of the absolute best things you can do for your well being AND for your wallet is to invest in yourself in some sort of way. I really think the reason why some of us don't "invest" in ourselves is that we fear we won't be perfect at whatever it is that we're trying to do, so we'd rather not try at all. I get it, as a fellow perfectionist that's constantly working on that, I totally understand.  BUT sometimes we just need to do something different and out of our comfort zones to truly better ourselves.  Now when I say "invest in yourself" I don't necessarily mean only monetary ways, like professional development/workshops/educational purposes...though those are awesome! I also mean investing in things like your health, hobbies, relationships, etc.  Tune in to the episode to find out the 5 ways you can start investing in yourself today!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/minisode13 Links mentioned:    SSR Podcast My interview on the SSR podcast Day in the Life of Alli Hoff Kosik, Freelance Writer Sign up for the Day in the Life newsletter    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about creativity and how it can make your life better.   Creativity was a topic that came a lot throughout my interview with Eric Lee of Left Field Labs both in the workplace and in life.   I think most people either label themselves as "creative" or "not creative" but in reality, everyone is creative in their own individual way.   Creativity is one of the most important characteristics of being human. A creative mind can enrich your life, making life so much more interesting instead of going aimlessly throughout your days. Being creative doesn't mean that you have to be an artist, maker, or creator of some sort...there are ways to be creative throughout your daily life and that's what we're going to cover in today's minisode!   I share a personal example of how I'm trying to creatively approach a new way thinking about how I spend my time and I'd love to hear your thoughts on creativity. Be sure to head on over to the Facebook group and join the conversation!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/creativity   Like the show? There are several ways you can help!

Hey hey happy minisode Friday! This week's interview with Nicholas Collins was a fun one and one thing we talked about a lot was social media and the presence it plays in kids lives.   As someone that started their career in social media, I've always had a weird relationship with it. Like, part of me loves it and it's brought me to some of my closest friends. It can definitely be used for inspiration and connection.   But the other part of me really struggles with it because I don't want to feel constantly tied to my phone and to be honest, I like having part of my life private. I don't want to share EVERYTHING about my life.   It's hard for me to completely disconnect because it is very tied to my job, but at times I do have to completely step away.   In today's minisode, I share reasons why we should ALL spend less time on social media and 3 tips on how you can limit your time.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com//less-time-social-media   Links mentioned:     Moment iPhone app  AntiSocial Android app    Like the show?

Hey hey happy minisode Friday! This week's interview with Nicholas Collins was a fun one and one thing we talked about a lot was social media and the presence it plays in kids lives.   As someone that started their career in social media, I've always had a weird relationship with it. Like, part of me loves it and it's brought me to some of my closest friends. It can definitely be used for inspiration and connection.   But the other part of me really struggles with it because I don't want to feel constantly tied to my phone and to be honest, I like having part of my life private. I don't want to share EVERYTHING about my life.   It's hard for me to completely disconnect because it is very tied to my job, but at times I do have to completely step away.   In today's minisode, I share reasons why we should ALL spend less time on social media and 3 tips on how you can limit your time.   Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com//less-time-social-media   Links mentioned:     Moment iPhone app  AntiSocial Android app    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about budgeting! I was not always a budgeter, that's for sure. In fact, I really didn't start budgeting until about 6 years ago, when I was 24 years old.   There are plenty of ways to budget: some people prefer using apps, others prefer using a specific spreadsheet.   One thing that I've learned as an adult is that it's extremely important to plan ahead and budget. Budgeting is what allowed me to start my own business and get ahead at life.   In this episode, I share why budgeting is important and more importantly, how to get started!   Enjoy!   Full show notes at: how-i-budget   Links mentioned:    You Need a Budget Mint Every Dollar    Like the show?

Today's mini-sode we're talking about asking for help. Yes, I know how hard it is. But we have to start asking for help otherwise you're going to hit burnout (please, learn from my mistakes).   I've always had trouble asking for help, even from a young age. I've always felt this pressure to never ask for help, almost like it was a failure or weak to enlist someone else to help me, no matter what the task was.   It's difficult to ask for help because we fear rejection. We fear being seen as "less than" or "found out."   But ultimately, it's important to know where our strengths lie and where they don't. Sometimes, the most efficient way to move forward in life is to focus our efforts on what we do best, and leave the rest for someone else.   In this episode I share more about my struggles asking for help, research behind why it's so dang hard to ask for it, and 3 tips to help you...ask for help!   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/how-to-ask-for-help   Links mentioned:     Why it’s hard to ask for help, Good Therapy  Why asking for help is so hard to do, Psychology Today  7 Effective Ways To Ask for Help, Psychology Today    Like the show?

I've really struggled with this, especially after becoming an entrepreneur. After the news came out about Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain's suicides, I was in complete shock.

Hence why I'm sharing my own experiences, thoughts, and advice on this mini-sode on how to take care of yourself.   This is something that I'm constantly balancing, so I'm no expert but if I can help one person out there I'll consider this a job well done.   If you feel you are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

On today's show, I have Colt Keo-Meier who is a Clinical Psychologist and Transgender Advocate located in Galveston, Texas.   I asked Colt to come on to not only discuss what it's like to be a Clinical Psychologist but also as someone who is transgender and an advocate.   My whole purpose behind starting this podcast is to show that even though our day-to-day tasks may all look vastly different, there are similarities we all have. We all have struggles. We all have fears. We all have insecurities. We all just want to be accepted in the world and be who we truly are.   Colt is very open and honest about his experience coming out to his family and the challenges he faced growing up in a small, south Texas town. He also shares misconceptions people have about transgender men and women as well as advice for people who want to talk more openly with their transgender friends and family members but aren't sure how to start.   This episode came out in April 2018 and my hope is that it is a resource for those wanting to learn more about what life is like for someone who is transgender. If this topic is new and/or uncomfortable to you, my hope is that you will listen with an open mind.   If you want to discuss this further, please join the Day in the Life Facebook group.   I also want to link to a suicide crisis hotline that is specific for transgender people. Please contact them if you are considering suicide. Trans Lifeline volunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our community might have: https://www.translifeline.org/ Phone Number: US: (877) 565-8860 CANADA: (877) 330-6366   Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/029 In today's episode, you'll find out:    The differences between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. How Colt's mental health has changed since transitioning. What he wants people to understand about transgender men and women. His biggest struggles being a clinical psychologist and transman. Misconceptions he thinks people have about transgender men and women. Advice he'd give to people who want to talk more openly with their friends and family about gender identity, but aren't sure how to start.    Links mentioned:    Transgender Alliance Facebook group PFLAG Gender Infinity Conference Family Acceptance Project    Follow Colt:    Website Colt's children's book, Stacey's Not A Girl    Like the show?

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/027-barbara-parker-advocate-for-sensible-gun-legislation/id1292726596?i=1000407574116
Hi all. This week's episode has a little different format than the others, as we don't necessarily walk through someone's day like we normally do.   I got the opportunity to interview Barbara Parker, mother of Alison Parker who was a news reporter who was fatally shot on live television in 2015.   With the Parkland shooting happening a few months ago at the time of this recording, I felt it was important to share and educate listeners (and myself) on what it's like to be an advocate for sensible gun control.   Wherever your opinions lie on the spectrum of gun legislation I urge you to listen to this episode. We cover a lot of topics: What she means by her title as an advocate for sensible gun control, how her role as an activist has affected relationships in her life, how she was able to turn her grief into action, the biggest obstacles she faces while being an activist, what she would tell lawmakers and President Trump about gun control, and most importantly, actionable tips on how you can educate yourself on these issues and advocate for stricter gun laws.   As always, I'm very open to an honest, civil dialogue about any topic we talk about here on the Day in the Life podcast. If you want to share your thoughts on an episode or connect with other listeners, join our Facebook group to start a healthy discussion.   Honored that you're listening and thankful for the support.   In today's episode, you'll find out:    Definition of what an advocate for sensible gun legislation is. How her role as a gun control activist has effected her relationships. How she was able to turn her grief into action. What she would say to members leading the NRA about gun control. What she wishes people knew about being a gun control activist. The biggest obstacles she faces in her activism work. Her response to people when they say it's a mental health issue and not a gun control issue. How you can talk to friends and loved ones about gun control more openly. One thing she would tell lawmakers & President Trump about gun control. A moment that she feels her daughter would be most proud of during her activist work. Actionable steps people can take if they want to get more involved on enacting change with our current laws on gun control.    Full show notes at: http://brittneyllynn.com/027   Links mentioned:    Andy Parker's Facebook page (Barbara's husband) Everytown for Gun Safety Everytown for Gun Safety Facebook page Moms Demand Action Moms Demand Action Facebook page Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence Coalition to Stop Gun Violence Facebook page Honr Network    Like the show?

This episode is probably one of my favorites because our conversation took an unexpected turn. As Paul was talking about how he was led to work in ministry later in life, we discussed what later led him out of the ministry. One of those reasons was how his church congregation felt about homosexuality and Christianity.  I think our conversation will surprise and enlighten you and I hope no matter what you feel about this topic that you will open your heart and mind while you listen.Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How he got called to become a pastor later in life.

Grateful for your support!   On today's show, I have Paul Meier, who is a Former Lutheran Pastor located in Eastern Kentucky.  This episode is probably one of my favorites because our conversation took an unexpected turn. As Paul was talking about how he was led to work in ministry later in life, we discussed what later led him out of the ministry. One of those reasons was how his church congregation felt about homosexuality and Christianity.  I think our conversation will surprise and enlighten you and I hope no matter what you feel about this topic that you will open your heart and mind while you listen.Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy!   In today’s episode, you'll find out:    How he got called to become a pastor later in life. How he emotionally handled being exposed to people's worst moments of their lives. If he ever experienced burnout. His thoughts on gay couples and Christianity. The difficult and most rewarding parts about being a pastor. Advice he'd give to people who are a beginner at learning about Christianity.

Katie Hunt of Tradeshow Bootcamp was one of my first PR clients that I started working with late last year and I’m so honored to be a part of her incredible team. If you aren’t familiar Katie, Tradeshow Bootcamp offers educational workshops (both online and in person!) to creative entrepreneurs who want to learn how to sell wholesale, exhibit at tradeshows, and learn about a variety of business topics. She’s coached over 700 brands, some of who have products in Anthropologie, Hallmark, Target, and more. The TSBC alumni community and the support they have for one another is exceptional and I feel super lucky to get to be a part of it. In today’s episode, you'll find out:  Why she doesn't schedule meetings before 10am. How her and her husband tag team the mornings. How she went from working in her corporate job in the law industry to work in the creative entrepreneur space selling stationery on Etsy. How Tradeshow Bootcamp came to be and what motivated her to start this business. How she keeps track of all of the moving pieces of her business. The moment she felt ready enough to finally leave her full-time corporate job and take her business full-time. Why she doesn't outsource her social media management for the TSBC brand. One of her biggest struggles she's had running a business and being an entrepreneur. Her fears about outsourcing and hiring a team. A big misconception people have about being an entrepreneur. Decision fatigue and how it affects you as a business owner. What she's the most proud of from building TSBC.

Ever wonder what a day in the life is like for an Online Life Coach? Now’s your chance! Kali Rogers of Blush Online Life Coaching was one of my first business BFFs and now good friend and client. Kali’s story of how she started her business is so inspiring to me and I love her witty personality and generous demeanor. She’s helped me have a lot of business breakthroughs and I feel so fortunate to call her a friend. In addition to chatting about how she started Blush, we of course chat about a typical day in her life. She doesn’t stick to the traditional entrepreneur mindset of getting up at 5 am, which is a refreshing revelation as many people assume to run a successful business you have to be a morning person. Excited for you to tune in and hope you enjoy! In today’s episode, you'll find out:  Why she's not a morning person and why she gave up coffee for good. How Blush came to be and how she pitched herself to a big company (and failed). How Blush works and who it's for. What Kali thinks people misconceive about being a life coach. What the difference between life coaching and counseling is and the stigmas behind each. Why Kali hates having her day completely planned out ahead of time and why setting intentions works best for her. Why Kali doesn't formally "exercise" and walks instead.
